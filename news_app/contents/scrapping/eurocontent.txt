Rare footage of a polar bear chasing a reindeer into the water and killing it could be another stark indication of climate change.After the female polar bear drowns the male victim, she drags it ashore in a move that indicates a change of diet for bears in Norway's Svalbard archipelago.The video was taken by a research team from a nearby Polish scientific station who watched it happen and caught the spectacle on camera for the first time.Retreating sea ice leaves bears stranded on land for longer periods. So, with fewer seals and a steadily rising reindeer population in Svalbard - it appears polar bears are being forced to change their eating habits.The incident is being seen as one of a series of observations that suggest polar bears are increasingly preying on land-based animals to make up for their limited access to their normal diet.In Svalbard, just over 1,000 kilometres from the North Pole and where signposts warn of the danger of polar bears, some 300 sedentary bears live alongside around 20,000 reindeer.There are now indications that polar bears have been hunting reindeer more frequently in recent decades.The facts that bears are stranded on land and that the number of reindeer has been steadily rising on Svalbard due to a 1925 hunting ban have resulted in the unusual phenomenon.Eating reindeer has become a matter of both necessity and opportunity for polar bears.But it is largely being seen as yet further evidence of a changing climate.

Many people aren’t travelling at the moment because they just don’t want to deal with the hassle and cost of COVID-19 tests. The UK’s rules can be confusing, especially as the government often changes them at short notice.But travel is still allowed to and from the UK, so read on to make sure you know the rules, and how to follow them to save time.Everyone arriving into the UK, whether they are vaccinated or not, must do a day 2 test.The rules are different if you are flying from a red list country, so check the status of the country you are arriving from first.As of 04:00 GMT on 30 November, the day 2 test must be a PCR test. You must self-isolate until you have received a negative resultYou will need your booking reference for your passenger locator form, which can be filled in up to 48 hours before your flight.Therefore, you must book your day 2 test before you arrive at the airport to take your flight to the UK.Previously, since 24 October, an antigen or lateral flow test was allowed.However, this weekend UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that PCR tests will now be required for all arrivals, regardless of vaccination status or country of origin. This is in response to the Omicron COVID-19 strain, which has been labelled by the World Health Organization as a 'variant of concern' and posing a "very high" global risk.Note that the green and amber lists were scrapped on October 4 2021. The red list was entirely removed in October too, but as of this week 10 countries have been re-added to the list.You can find out more about this here.Despite the name, you can actually do the test on or before day 2. This rule is stated on the UK government website here.This means that you can get tested as soon as you land in the UK. Most airports have testing centres, and getting it done when you arrive means you don’t need to worry about doing it on your actual day 2. You could also do it on the way home from the airport, or the next day. But remember you must self-isolate and only leave where you are staying for essential reasons such as testing.Don’t forget: day 0 is the day you arrive into the UK, then the next day is day 1, and so on.There are lots of different companies that you can book a test through online. But not all test providers are created equal.In terms of private providers, some companies offer at-home options sent by mail, or in-person testing. The government has a handy guide about which test might be right for you here.Remember to make your online booking in time to put the booking reference, which you'll receive by email, on your passenger locator form.There are company you might want to avoid, for now at least.On September 24th, the UK Competition and Markets Authority revealed they are investigating Dante Labs for not delivering tests or test results on time or at all, not responding to customer complaints, refusing or delaying to pay refunds and having unfair terms and conditions.

Your results will still be accepted as valid.The other testing company under investigation is Expert Medicals.They are similarly being investigated for not sending out tests and results, not responding to customer complaints and refusing to issue refunds when due.You can find the list of government-approved testing providers here.The UK’s Citizens Advice Bureau can provide support via their website.You can also email dhsctesttrace.customerfeedbackteam@nhs.net for more advice.Many of our readers have questions about the UK's travel requirements.We put these questions to the government departments responsible for the rules. Their answers are below.According to the government, airlines are responsible for checking that passengers are following the guidance."There is no specific guidance on reporting as this is done by laboratories, but passengers must self-isolate for 10 days if they receive a positive test result," says the spokesperson.Irish and British citizens travelling between the UK and Ireland do not count as 'international travellers' because of the Common Travel Area.At the moment, this guidance has not changed and British or Irish citizens travelling from Ireland into the UK are not required to fill out a Passenger Locator Form (PLF) or take a COVID-19 PCR test.However, non-British and non-Irish citizens entering the UK are likely to still need a PLF and a PCR test.The guidance around this is still changing, so we recommend contacting your travel provider for further clarity.Yes - if you're travelling from abroad you will still need to book a day 2 test, even if you are in the UK for less than two days.You will need to fill out a Passenger Locator Form (PLF), even for a short trip, which requires a day 2 test booking number.If you are only coming to the UK to transfer to another country, you will not need to book a day 2 test - as long as you are only in the UK for transit purposes.If you remain 'airside' only, and do not pass through border control, then you do not need to fill out a Passenger Locator Form (PLF).If you are a 'landside' transit, and need to pass through border control, you will need to fill out a PLF but still do not need to book a day 2 test.Instead you will do the following on the form:These rules only apply to fully vaccinated travellers who have not been in red-list countries in the past 10 days. For more information, click here.Yes, children aged 5-17 need to take a day 2 PCR test when arriving into the UK - regardless of whether or not they are vaccinated.Children aged 17 and under do not need to quarantine, however.There is more information on travelling with children here.
