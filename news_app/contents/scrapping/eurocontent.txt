India is on track to ban all but a few private cryptocurrencies after the government announced on Tuesday it was introducing a new financial regulation bill.The 'Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency' bill will create a facilitative framework for an official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India, and ban all private cryptocurrencies.Such a pre-verification approach would create obstacles for thousands of peer-to-peer currencies that thrive on being outside the ambit of regulatory scrutiny.The price of Bitcoin dropped after the news was announced, falling 1.19 per cent in the last 24 hours and was trading at $56,615.97 (€50,483.89) at 12 pm CET on Wednesday, according to coinmarketcap.com.Earlier this month, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said all democratic nations must work together to ensure cryptocurrency "does not end up in wrong hands, which can spoil our youth" - his first public comments on the subject.Earlier this year, the government considered criminalising the possession, issuance, mining, trading and transference of crypto-assets.Modi recently chaired a meeting to discuss the future of cryptocurrencies, amid concerns that unregulated crypto markets could become avenues for money laundering and terror financing, sources separately said on Saturday.The new rules are also likely to discourage marketing and advertising of cryptocurrencies, to dull their allure for retail investors, said an industry source who was part of a separate parliamentary panel discussion held on Monday.The government is looking to classify crypto as an asset class, as demanded by the crypto exchanges, rather than as a currency, two sources told Reuters.But the senior government official told Reuters that the plan is to ban private crypto-assets ultimately while paving the way for a new Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).The Reserve Bank of India, which has voiced "serious concerns" about private crypto is set to launch its CBDC by December.Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, is hovering around $60,000 (€53,000) and has more than doubled since the start of this year, attracting hordes of local investors.No official data is available but industry estimates suggest there are 15-20 million crypto investors in India, with total crypto holdings of around 400 billion rupees (€4.77 billion).Clarification: Originally we reported that Bitcoin and Ethereum would be among the coins that would be impacted by this ban which was incorrect. We have amended the article to rectify this error.
COVID-19 cases are on the rise again in various parts of Europe as the cold weather has affected the spread of the virus.Countries on the Old Continent are attempting to curb the spike through various means - from a national lockdown in Austria, to limiting access to certain services elsewhere, or pushing for an increase in vaccination rates.EU ministers met to discuss the rollout of booster shots and their impact on the bloc's digital vaccination pass.Around 60% of people in Western Europe are fully immunised against COVID-19, but only about half as many are vaccinated in Eastern Europe.The World Health Organization has warned Europe and Central Asia could face another 700,000 COVID-19 deaths by March 1. It said deaths due to COVID-19 rose to nearly 4,200 per day last week — a doubling of levels recorded at the end of September.Here is a run-down of the latest situation in some of the European countries.The epidemic in France is "deteriorating", the government has said as the country reported more than 30,000 new daily cases.Health minister Olivier Véran is expected to announce new measures on Thursday (November 25) concerning booster doses, more preventive measures such as mask-wearing, and possible changes to the health pass.The government recently indicated that the number of school classes forced to close -- over 6,000 -- was at its highest level since the term began in September.Prime Minister Jean Castex has also tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday (November 22) at a time when more and more people are coming down with the virus.Some 76,8% of France's 67.4 million people are fully vaccinated, according to the latest figures."There are nine times more critical care admissions and deaths among the unvaccinated than among the vaccinated," Government spokesman Gabriel Attal said.In a bid to encourage older people to come forward for a third dose of the vaccine, President Macron has said that from mid-December, a booster jab will be needed in order for people aged over 65 to have their health passes extended.The Italian government on Wednesday decided to exclude unvaccinated people from certain leisure activities in a bid to contain rising coronavirus infections and avoid financially crippling lockdowns.Starting December 6, only people with proof of vaccination or of having recovered from COVID-19 can eat at indoor restaurants, go to the movies or attend sporting events. Having just a negative test result is no longer acceptable in what was dubbed a "reinforced" or super green pass.A new government decree also made vaccinations mandatory for law enforcement, military, and all school employees, among others. Previously, vaccines were only required for health care workers.Twenty towns in Italy's South Tyrol province face harsher COVID-19 restrictions from Wednesday (November 24) with an 8 pm curfew due to high infections and low vaccinations.On public transport, passengers must wear an FFP2 mask or equivalent.Earlier in November, Italy tightened its green pass rules in an attempt to slow down the infection rate before the end-of-the-year holiday season.According to the new set of restrictions, trains can now be stopped in case any of the passengers appear to have COVID symptoms, while all taxi drivers are required to have a valid green pass, with the limit of two passengers seated in the back also becoming mandatory.Italy has already updated its international travel rules in late October. The five-grade system can effectively ban entry for anything except work and family reasons depending on the tier of the country of origin, but most European countries are still in the middle “C” tier. However, this might change by December 15, when the rules are supposed to be updated.The country’s authorities reported 44 COVID-related deaths on Monday (November 15), an uptick from 36 the day before. The number of infections went down, from 7,569 on Sunday to 5,144. Italy still has the second-highest overall death toll on the continent, with 132,819 deaths from COVID placing it right after the UK.Austria has gone back into a national lockdown as of Monday (November 22), becoming the first EU country to take such a measure in the face of the COVID-19 resurgence.The lockdown will last at least 10 days but could extend to 20, officials said.Conservative Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg has also said that vaccination will become compulsory from February 1.The announcement came a few days after the country implemented a nationwide lockdown for people who are unvaccinated, which came into force on November 15, but this did not slow the spread of the virus sufficiently.People 12 years and older are banned from going outside except for essential activities such as work, attending classes, grocery shopping, or for a walk. The number of police patrols has been increased and those found breaking the rules can be fined up to €1,450."In the long term, the way out of this vicious circle we are in — and it is a vicious circle, we are stumbling from wave to lockdown, and that can't carry on ad infinitum — is only vaccination," Schallenberg said earlier this week.According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), just over 64% of the population was fully vaccinated by November 19, slightly below the EU average (65.5%). Coronavirus cases have continued to rise, hitting a record daily total of 15,809 on Friday.Authorities in Austria said on November 17 that travellers would need to show a negative PCR test upon entering the country. Previously, results from the cheaper lateral flow tests were allowed.Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in the capital Brussels on Sunday, protesting against reinforced COVID-19 restrictions.Police estimated there were some 35,000 at the rally, but many had already left when the demonstration descended into violence. Several hundred people started pelting police, smashing cars and setting garbage bins ablaze, with the police deploying water cannons to try to control the crowd.From Monday 22 November, employees are expected to work from home for at least four days a week, with mask-wearing compulsory in public places.Anyone over 10 years old must wear one on public transport, in bars and restaurants, theatres and cinemas, and at public events including those held outdoors.Until now, health passes have allowed for masks to be taken off indoors. The pass is to be extended to Christmas markets, events with over 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors, and private events in bars and restaurants.Vaccinations for children aged between five and 11 will begin "as soon as possible" on a voluntary basis, following the green light from Belgian regulators and approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) which has been analysing the results of clinical tests of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on children.Hospital admissions are going up at a rate of 30% per week and have reached their highest level since May. More than a quarter of hospital patients are in ICU, further straining the healthcare system.Belgium has been in the midst of a spike in cases since about a month ago, when the government reimposed some restrictions, having relaxed them a few weeks earlier. However, infections have continued to rise, with more than 10,000 reported each day over the past week.Russia's record high coronavirus death toll persisted for a second straight day on Saturday, as the number of new infections declined.The state coronavirus task force reported 1,254 COVID-19 deaths, matching Friday's tally.The task force also reported 37,120 new confirmed cases. The daily new infections in recent weeks appear to have a downward trend but still remain higher than during previous surges of the virus.The latest surge in infections and deaths comes amid low vaccination rates and lax public attitudes toward taking precautions. About 40% of Russia’s nearly 146 million people have been fully vaccinated, even though the country approved a domestically developed COVID-19 vaccine months before most of the world.On Sunday president Vladimir Putin announced that he had received a third dose of the COVID vaccine.In total, the coronavirus task force has reported nearly 9.3 million confirmed infections and 262,843 COVID-19 deaths, by far the highest death toll in Europe.Some experts believe the true figure is even higher.German soldiers could soon be required to get a COVID-19 jab, the defence ministry confirmed to Euronews, amid a debate over vaccine mandates.Germans will be "vaccinated, cured or dead" by the end of the winter due to the current outbreak of COVID-19 infections in the country, Health Minister Jens Spahn had warned warned."Presumably by the end of the winter everyone will be vaccinated, cured or dead" because of the spread of the "very, very contagious" Delta variant, the minister said, once again calling on Germans to get vaccinated "urgently" in the face of an explosion in coronavirus cases in recent weeks.Chancellor Angela Merkel already announced the government will introduce tighter COVID-19 restrictions on unvaccinated citizens.In most regions, only the vaccinated and those who have recovered from the virus will be able to access public places such as restaurants or concert halls.The country's lower house of parliament the Bundestag voted on Thursday in favour of new restrictions. The plans include new restrictions for the workplace and public transport.The measures were proposed by the three parties expected to form the next coalition: the Social Democrats (SPD), the liberals and the greens.Health authorities issued a stark warning as 65,371 new cases were reported in a single day, confirming an upward trend experts have been warning about for weeks."We are currently heading toward a serious emergency,” said Lothar Wieler, director of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's disease control agency. "We are going to have a really terrible Christmas if we don't take countermeasures now."He called for a significant increase in vaccination rates to well above 75%, from 67.7% at present. In some German regions rates are as low as 57.6%.Wieler also urged the closure of bars and clubs, an end to large-scale events and for many other places to be restricted to those with vaccine or recovery certificates.Hundreds of protesters marched in Prague on Monday (November 22) against the government’s restrictions on unvaccinated people.Coronavirus infections in the Czech Republic hit a new record for the second time this week, the Health Ministry said on Saturday. It announced that the daily tally jumped to 22,936 on Friday, almost 500 more than the previous record set on Tuesday.The country’s infection rate has risen to 929 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days.In a worrying sign, 110 people died on Thursday, the ministry said, with the daily death toll surpassing 100 for the first time since April.The government has approved new restrictions to tackle the surge, targeting the unvaccinated in an effort to increase a vaccination rate that is below the European Union average.Starting Monday, most unvaccinated people will no longer be allowed to show negative coronavirus tests in order to attend public events, go to bars and restaurants, visit hairdressers, museums and similar facilities or use hotels.Only people who are vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 will remain eligible.Overall, the nation of 10.7 million has registered almost 2 million cases with 32,005 deaths.Greece announced a variety of new coronavirus-related restrictions on Thursday, aimed at putting additional pressure on those who have not yet been vaccinated.They include tougher limits on access to non-essential indoor venues and a seven-month expiration date on passes for over-60 year-olds who have not yet had a booster shot.Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he believed the measures would help "those who are still hesitant" to change their minds and get vaccinated."From next Monday, all adult unvaccinated citizens, in addition to catering, will not enter other indoor areas, not even if they carry test results: In cinemas, theatres, museums or gyms," he said.Greece is suffering its highest rate of confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic with deaths at their worst level in six months.About two-thirds of all Greeks are now fully vaccinated and three-in-four adults. But the numbers vary wildly around the country: the northern regions, in particular, have a very low rate -- well under 50% in some places.The Swedish government has announced that from December 1 a health pass will be required to attend any event of more than 100 people. The COVID pass — attesting that the holder has either been fully vaccinated, tested negative over the previous 72 hours or recovered from the disease over the preceding six months — has so far only been used in Sweden for travel purposes.The government also reversed its November 1 decision to stop testing fully vaccinated people.Even though Sweden is currently recording few cases — the daily average over the previous seven days is 840 cases — the country "is not isolated from the rest of the world", health minister Lena Hallengren told reporters on Wednesday.Restaurants and bars are exempt for the time being.Sweden lifted almost all its anti-Covid restrictions by the end of September due to the progress of its vaccination programme and the good epidemic situation.The country currently has an incidence rate of 85.8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the past 14 days, according to the WHO — one of the lowest rates in Europe and far behind its neighbours Norway and Denmark, which are now experiencing a surge in cases after lifting most of their health measures.Slovakia reported more than 10,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time, with 10,315 people testing positive on Tuesday (November 23). That's over 1,000 more than the previous record registered Friday.As of Monday 22 November, unvaccinated people are banned from all non-essential stores and shopping malls in Slovakia.They are also no longer allowed to attend any public event or gathering and will be required to test twice a week just to go to work.“A merry Christmas does not mean a Christmas without COVID-19,” warned Prime Minister Eduard Heger. “For that to happen, Slovakia would need to have a completely different vaccination rate.”He called the measures “a lockdown for the unvaccinated.”Just 45.3% of the 5.5 million population is fully vaccinated, and the country is recording record number of cases.The government is ready to impose even more restrictions if the situation doesn't improve, the prime minister said.Thousands in both Czech and Slovakian capitals, Prague and Bratislava, used Wednesday’s anniversary of the 1989 anti-communist Velvet Revolution to rally against their government’s upcoming coronavirus restrictions.The protesters ignored social distancing and didn’t wear masks.New COVID-19 restrictions came into force in Ireland on Thursday (November 18) due to high rates of infection that have put pressure on hospitals.People were told to work from home unless attending the workplace is "absolutely necessary". A requirement for COVID-19 passes (based on vaccination or recovery) is extended to cinemas and theatres, while closing times for all on-licensed premises, including in hotels, will move to midnight.With immediate effect, household close contacts who are fully vaccinated and showing no symptoms should restrict their movements until they have 3 negative antigen test results taken within a 5-day period.Announcing the measures, Prime Minister Micheal Martin said that without the country's massive vaccination campaign, Ireland would be in "total lockdown". Nearly 90% of people over 12 years old are fully vaccinated.The measures follow stark warnings from health officials, who say modelling predicts a steep rise in case numbers and hospital admissions under the most pessimistic scenarios.As the daily death toll in the country reached a record-breaking 832 on Tuesday (November 16), Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that those who receive two jabs of the vaccine will be given a payment of 1,000 hryvnias, or about 33 euros in an attempt to alleviate vaccination reluctance.The average nominal wage in Ukraine was around 13 thousand hryvnias earlier in 2021, while the minimum salary rests at six thousand, according to the country's State Statistics Service.Statistics on how many people received both doses vary greatly, with reports claiming that it stands anywhere between 20 and 28 per cent. The country of 41 million has been in the throes of the latest wave for weeks, forcing a reintroduction of significant restrictions in several cities, including Kyiv.Social distancing will become mandatory once again in the Netherlands from Wednesday, meaning police will be able to enforce it. Everyone aged 18 and older is obliged to keep 1.5 metres away from each other, unless they live at the same address.There are some exceptions for when it is not possible to keep distance or for when a COVID pass is required.In response to a spike in those testing positive for COVID-19, the Dutch caretaker government implemented a partial lockdown on November 13 that is due to run for at least three weeks, forcing bars and restaurants to close at 8 pm.The soaring number of cases in this nation of 17.5 million comes despite more than 84% of the Dutch adult population being fully vaccinated. Cases rose sharply among children aged 4-12, most of whom have yet to be inoculated.The country has seen protests in a number of cities against the measures, with unrest on Sunday for a third consecutive evening. Police said some 145 people have been arrested over the last three days.Fifteen people were arrested in Rosendaal after protesters set fire to a primary school.Demonstrators also set off fireworks and caused extensive damage in the cities of Enschede, Groningen, Leeuwarden in the north and Tilburg in the south.Hospitals in the southern province of Limburg — the hardest-hit Dutch region — stated in a letter to the health ministry that they are ”heading straight for a healthcare blockage and the entire system is grinding to a standstill.”After nearly 4,000 new cases were reported on November 12, Tanja Stadler, head of the country’s COVID-19 Task Force said that hospitals might have to admit up to 30,000 COVID patients this winter, according to the Swiss outlet Le Matin.About 64.9% of the alpine country's population is fully vaccinated according to the latest figures. Meanwhile, anti-vaxxers demonstrated against a government-led vaccination drive, with riot police having to protect public vaccination sites in places like Zurich.Bulgaria has topped the list of countries worldwide in the number of COVID-related deaths. With the latest figure reaching 283.68 deaths per one million inhabitants, the wave in this Balkan country has still not relented.The grim situation has deteriorated to the point where hospitals in Bulgaria are forced to temporarily suspend all non-emergency surgeries so more doctors can treat the influx of COVID-19 patients.At the same time, parents across the country have protested a measure demanding that schoolchildren be tested once a week in order for in-person classes to resume. Protests against the Green Passes also entered their third week.Bulgaria, which held its third general elections of the year on Sunday, has the lowest double vaccination rate among EU member states, sitting squarely at about 23%.Like Bulgaria, Romania has found itself in the throes of a deadly spike in cases, with reports claiming that the morgue in the main hospital in the capital has run out of space for the dead in recent days.Five European countries -- Italy, Germany, Hungary, Austria, and Poland -- offered to help Romania treat as many patients in critical condition as possible, and just last Wednesday, four Romanians with severe forms of COVID-19 were flown to Italy.Although the cases seem to be on a downward trajectory, the current bi-weekly average of 724.42 citizens testing positive for COVID-19 is still considered to be grave in a country of 19.29 million.​In Serbia, the rate of fully vaccinated citizens has slowed down significantly since May and remains at 43%, despite the country’s initial success in procuring a large number of vaccines by several different producers as early as January.The country of almost 7 million has been averaging at least five thousand cases per day since mid-September.The government responded by reintroducing some light measures, such as bars, cafes, restaurants, and other public venues requesting their guests present a COVID pass after 10 pm.Serbian prime minister Ana Brnabić’s statement last month that she “doesn’t believe in [going back to] the same measures that were implemented before the vaccines,” pondering the purpose of the vaccines altogether if lockdowns continue to be a necessity, has come under heavy scrutiny.Some doctors are now threatening to sue her due to conditions in certain hospitals that forced the medical workers to focus exclusively on treating COVID patients. Brnabić has rejected that criticism, saying on Thursday that she is proud of her government's response.Meanwhile, authorities at the graveyard in Belgrade say they have an average of 65 burials a day, compared to between 35 and 40 before the pandemic. Gravediggers are forced to bury people on Sundays — which typically they didn't — to handle the load.Soaring infections appear to have been a wake-up call to some extent in Croatia, which saw unusually large lines of people waiting for vaccines in recent days.Authorities said on Wednesday (November 17) that more than 15,000 people received their first dose a day earlier — a significant jump after vaccinations had all but halted in the Adriatic country of 4.2 million.At the same time, anti-vaxxers held vigils in a number of cities in the country after the government announced plans to introduce mandatory COVID passes for government and public employees, including school teachers.Some protesters were seen wearing a yellow Star of David, imitating those forced on the European Jewry in Nazi Germany, local outlet Index.hr reported.The country’s health authorities might have to bin about 30 thousand doses of AstraZeneca vaccines that are about to expire, according to local outlets' reports on Tuesday (November 16).The soon-to-be inert AstraZeneca doses are only used as a second vaccine for those age 60 and above, which further complicates the issue.Health experts in the country are warning that North Macedonia might be headed towards a major peak in the upcoming weeks, especially considering a relatively low vaccination rate of 37% and the ongoing waves in neighbouring countries like Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria.Last month, Latvia introduced a nighttime curfew from 20:00 to 05:00 due to the worsening coronavirus situation in the Baltic country of 1.9 million. Most stores were closed, and indoor and outdoor gatherings, including entertainment, sports, and cultural events weren’t allowed.As these restrictions ended on Monday (November 15), the government has now revised its measures, allowing for those with certificates proving vaccination or recovery to access all services.Restrictions are still in place for the unvaccinated, who can as of Monday only do basic things outside of their homes, such as grocery shopping or travel with public transportation.The country also banned unvaccinated MPs from attending parliament and participating in meetings.Latvia is still seeing a significant number of cases emerge, with a bi-weekly average of 1,533.33 testing positive per 100,000 inhabitants.On November 12, Denmark reintroduced its digital pass as it declared COVID-19 “a socially critical disease” once again amid an increase in cases.For the next month, a valid pass is mandatory in order to enter nightclubs or cafes or to be seated indoors in restaurants.People above the age of 15 must show their pass when attending outdoor events where the number of people exceeds 2,000.The Danish pass app shows a QR code with a green banner if the holder is fully vaccinated or received the first dose at least two weeks ago, has recently recovered from COVID-19 or has had a negative test in the past 72 hours. A paper version is also available.Watch the full interview with the WHO special envoy on COVID-19 David Nabarro in the video player above.Additional sources • AP, AFP
Faced with a sharp rise in energy consumption, Swedish authorities are calling on the European Union to ban "energy intensive" crypto mining.Erik Thedéen, director of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, and Björn Risinger, director of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, said cryptocurrency's rising energy usage is threatening Sweden's ability to meet its obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement.Between April and August this year, the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining in the Nordic country rose "several hundred per cent," and now consumes the equivalent electricity of 200,000 households, Thedéen and Risinger said.In an open letter, the directors of Sweden's top financial and environmental regulators called for an EU-wide ban on "proof of work" cryptocurrency mining, for Sweden to "halt the establishment" of new crypto mining operations and for companies that trade and invest in crypto assets to be prohibited from describing their business activities as environmentally sustainable.The key issue driving the Swedish regulators' intervention is the "proof of work" system used to mint many cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ether, the world's two largest tokens.Under the proof of work system, computers must solve mathematical puzzles in order to validate transactions that occur on a given network.The process is designed to become more difficult as the number of blocks of validated transactions in the chain increases, meaning more computing power - and therefore energy - is required.This leads to an arms race among miners, who compete to be the first to validate a new block and claim the prize of a new crypto coin: the more powerful your hardware, the more likely you are to get the coin.In recent months, the Nordic countries have seen a rise in crypto mining as producers attracted by lower energy prices and a relative abundance of renewable electricity flee China's crackdown on the industry.The growth of crypto mining brings with it an opportunity cost, Thedéen and Risinger said, as Sweden's renewable energy is diverted away from industrial, transport and domestic uses, and into Bitcoin and other tokens."It is currently possible to drive a mid-size electric car 1.8 million kilometres using the same energy it takes to mine one single Bitcoin,” they said.“This is the equivalent of forty-four laps around the globe. 900 bitcoins are mined every day. This is not a reasonable use of our renewable energy".Euronews Next has contacted the Swedish, Norwegian and Icelandic environment ministries and the European Commission to ask whether or not they support the call to ban proof of work mining.
Tensions have been rising again along the Russian-Ukrainian border, with Kyiv and Washington raising the alarm at what they say is an unusual build-up of Russian troops.Ukraine’s defence ministry claimed earlier this month that about 90,000 Russian soldiers were stationed near their border and in rebel-controlled areas in Ukraine’s east.Units of the Russian 41st army have remained in Yelnya, a town 260 kilometres north of the Ukrainian border, according to the ministry.“What we see is a significant, large Russian military build-up. We see an unusual concentration of troops. And we know that Russia has been willing to use these types of military capabilities before to conduct aggressive actions against Ukraine,” said NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg last week.The comments came after reports that the United States warned the European Union that Moscow might be planning an invasion of its ex-Soviet neighbour.Russian officials have denied they are planning incursions into Ukraine, citing what they called many threats from Ukraine and allegedly provocative actions by US warships in the Black Sea.Russia has supported a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine that erupted shortly after Moscow's 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. The conflict has left more than 14,000 people dead.In the spring of this year, a massive build-up of Russian troops near the border raised concerns in Ukraine and in the West, fueling fears of an escalation of hostilities.But the troops were eventually pulled out after a few weeks as US President Joe Biden held a summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.Could the latest military build-up be of a different nature, namely a prelude to a Russian invasion?Euronews spoke to military and foreign policy experts to shed light on the Russian troops' movements and their implications for Ukraine and its Western allies."Some of the important deployments we actually only know from satellite imagery, which is, of course, not the most accurate way to know about things," said Gustav Gressel, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR)."Often it's just radar imagery. So you know that there are of sort of military formations there because the vehicles they operate are full of iron, so they are not the typical lorry-type of reflection. But you don't know whether that's actually a self-propelled gun or a tank, a main battle tank, or another armoured fighting vehicle," the expert told Euronews."When it concerns the situation in Ukraine, Russian military forces around Ukraine are quite sizeable, even without Russia pulling any special build-up," Gressel told Euronews."However, that said, we still have a lot of movement and deployment of at least certain assets of the 41st Combined Arms Army (CAA) that was deployed into the Western Military District in spring this year that go round Yelnya in the Smolensk region."We know that on the Pogonovo training range, there are a lot of exercises and we have spotted some elements of different formations of the First Guard's Tank Army there," the Russia expert went on."And we see that some elements of units of the 58th Army, which is based in the northern Caucasus, have been moved to Crimea and we see an influx of equipment and people into Crimea.""We also see a lot of military aviation traffic in Rostov-on-Don -- not attack planes, but transport aircraft going in and out."We know that Russia has mobilised some parts of the National Guard, both local as well as from other parts, and sent them to Rostov-on-Don."The expert described Rostov-on-Don as "the central hub"."Things that come there basically end up being infiltrated into the Donbas," he said.Gressel wrote in a recent article that the mobilisation of the National Guard units is a sign the Kremlin is at least considering incursions into Ukraine"In addition to operational intelligence basically showing the movement of troops, there is what you call strategic intelligence," said Andriy Zagorodnyuk, chairman of the Centre for Defence Strategies, a think-tank, and former Ukrainian defence minister (2019-2020).He pointed to strategic intelligence recently shared by the US that Russia was allegedly getting ready for an invasion operation.Washington's warnings, Zagorodnyuk said, came around the same time as a rare visit of CIA director William J. Burns to Moscow two weeks ago."That means that they received information about decisions made at a strategic level in Moscow, basically the Minister of Defence of Moscow or the Presidency, and that intel was passed by the United States to all key partner allies -- basically NATO countries," the former minister told Euronews.But Katharine Quinn-Judge, an analyst who specialises in Ukraine at the International Crisis Group, told Euronews that she took "comments from officials on all sides about the extent of the build-up with a grain of salt"."In the spring, Ukrainian and EU officials were throwing around some slightly misleading figures for the number of Russian troops near Ukraine’s borders, figures that included troops near the frontline in Donbas. The latter is indeed at Ukraine’s de facto border and inside its internationally-recognised border. But they’re *always* there, so it’s misleading to include them in the number of troops Russia has supposedly amassed in recent weeks," she told Euronews."Knowing this makes me more sceptical of comments I’m seeing from Ukrainian and European officials today -- not that I find Russian statements reliable either," Quinn-Judge added.The experts interviewed by Euronews said the latest military build-up was different in many ways from what happened last spring.One difference, Zagorodnyuk told Euronews, is that Russia connected last spring's developments with military exercises, "which honestly wasn't the case because the exercises started much later, but at least they gave us gave some kind of explanation".Furthermore, he added, "we didn't have that sort of strategic intelligence about Russian preparations of a planned invasion. Now we do. So that's the difference, and that's why everybody is concerned," the former official noted."Compared to the situation in March and April 2021, when it last moved troops close to the Ukrainian border, Russia seems to be making much less effort to ensure the current assembly is visible. This may hint towards a significantly more serious intention than simply a wish to appear threatening," Gressel noted in his article.Another difference, he told Euronews, is that "the movements of the 41st rather concern NATO than Ukraine this time.""If you look, Smolensk Oblast is not the closest way to put this army to Ukraine. And actually in spring, when the signal was only about Ukraine, the 41st Army was deployed further east and further south."The expert noted that the military unit was currently closer to the border of Belarus than to that of Ukraine and linked it to the ongoing border crisis pitting EU countries Poland and Lithuania against Minsk.According to the expert, their presence there serves a training purpose, namely practising an "attack on Poland"."If Russia did start a war with NATO in the west, the 41st CAA’s task would be to lead the advance from Belarus towards the Suwalki gap. This is the Poland-Lithuania border area that separates Belarus from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The 41st CAA would likely advance in conjunction with the 11th Army Corps in Kaliningrad; its aim would be to crush the Polish and Lithuanian defences," the expert explained in his article.Gressel told Euronews that Russia's troop movements coincided with "a certain rhetoric" from Moscow, including "accusations against Ukraine leaving the Minsk Treaty" and "very specific demands on which legislation Ukraine would need to change, what laws it should adopt, which laws it should not adopt, how it should recognise the puppet republics in the Donbas, etc.""So all that is giving a picture that Russia really wants something and is underpinning this demands with military might," he told Euronews.Moscow, Gressel said, wants to have the Minsk agreement implemented on its own terms.The 2015 deal, which was brokered by France and Germany to help resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine, stipulated that Ukraine would regain full control of its border with Russia in the rebel-held territories only after the election of local leaders and legislatures.Kyiv recently introduced plans to adopt a law on transitional administration, promising to transition towards new authorities after elections under Ukrainian law."Moscow dislikes the contents of the draft legislation because they do not effectively allow it to retain the republics it set up in eastern Ukraine," wrote Gressel.On Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov leaked correspondence with his French and German counterparts on the negotiations known as "Normandy format".The group was organised by France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to settle the conflict.According to Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, the publication of the letters aimed to debunk Western claims that Moscow had declined to cooperate for a Normandy Format meeting."Leaking such cables is a severe breach of trust and protocol. It indicates the Kremlin has given up on Normandy/Minsk and will not further negotiate. On the other hand, it communicates the demands of Russia again -- Moscow has been demanding very forcefully in recent times," Gressel told Euronews.Zagorodnyuk said there was "an acceleration of the propaganda against Ukraine" on Russian TV, with the Russians "portraying themselves as the subject of Ukrainian aggression, which is obviously not the case.""They are basically preparing people for the fact that Russia needs to defend itself," Zagorodnyuk said.On Thursday, Putin accused the West of "escalating the Ukraine conflict.""(Our) Western partners are escalating the situation by supplying Kyiv with lethal modern weapons and conducting provocative military manoeuvres in the Black Sea," Putin said in a speech to the foreign ministry. He claimed Western bombers are flying "20 km from our border."Asked if Russia planned to invade Ukraine, Russia’s deputy UN ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, replied last week that it "never planned, never did, and (is) never going to do it unless we’re provoked by Ukraine, or by somebody else".Putin also has ramped up his dismissal of an independent Ukraine in recent months. A lengthy essay the Kremlin published in July asserts that Ukrainians and Russians are "one people" and the “true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia”."The fact that they're getting ready [for an invasion] does not mean that they will start it," said Zagorodnyuk."Making a preparation decision is a strategic military activity. But starting an operation of that scale is a political decision. And it has to be a very, very well calculated decision because the risks for Russia are huge," the former Ukrainian minister told Euronews.With Moscow well aware of the risks, the objective might be to raise the stakes in negotiations, he said, "by showing that they have enough power to destabilise the situation."Zagorodnyuk said the Geneva summit with President Biden, "which basically was portrayed as a meeting of two superpowers together," was an example of how the Russians used the previous military build-up "in order to get their place at the table and at a level which they think is proper for them".According to Gressel, a full-fledged escalation is not the most likely outcome of the recent troops' movements."So a limited escalation, one to destabilise Ukraine rather than to conquer, seems very likely. It would signal to Kyiv 'you can’t hide behind your army, you can’t hide behind France and Germany, either do as we say or have war,'" Gressel told Euronews."What the West can do and is already doing is sending political signals to Russia, saying they will not tolerate that, that they are monitoring the situation very closely and they are ready to help defend Ukraine," said Zagorodnyuk."We need a strong Western reaction" to prevent an escalation, Gressel told Euronews.Part of this response could be on the military front, Gressel said, "basically signalling to Russians: 'look, you could escalate but there might be ramifications to that. And if you attack eastern Ukraine further and deeper, we might send paratroopers. We can put them on readiness".The US has already sent ships to the Black Sea as part of NATO activity alongside Ukraine. In recent weeks, Washington has delivered military equipment as part of a $60 million (€53 million) package announced in September.Both Zagorodnyuk and Gressel furthermore referred to unconfirmed media reports claiming that the UK was allegedly ready to send special forces to Ukraine."In the last round of escalation, the American deployed a nuclear-signed aircraft to Poland to show that NATO is not completely spineless and we actually have means very close in place," the expert told Euronews."That also was a very powerful signal, as the Russians read this immediately and they reacted to it," he said.A summit with Putin, similar to his Geneva meeting with Biden earlier this year, could be another option to give the Russian leader "a face-saving exit", according to Gressel."One caveat with Western governments, the US included, unfortunately, is that when they meet with the Russians, they put themselves under enormous pressure to have a result. And such a summit that just serves as a means to massage the ego of Putin and give him a face-saving exit that he can sell to the Russian public and to his own pals that he was not defeated and he wasn't deterred -- even if in fact, of course, he was -- that will not bring any results," the expert nuanced.Quinn-Judge was just in Luhansk Oblast, in the easternmost part of Ukraine, when she spoke to Euronews."There wasn’t a sense of threat there - things were very subdued," she said in an email to us."One of the people I spoke to lives on the west side of Donetsk city, which is near one of the worst parts of the frontline. He said that the ceasefire agreement of July 2020 brought relief, but in the past few months 'they’re firing all the time'.”"To sum up, the people I spoke to were more concerned with the daily grind of poverty, isolation and low-level warfare than with some new threat of escalation/invasion," Quinn-Judge said.Every weekday at 1900 CET, Uncovering Europe brings you a European story that goes beyond the headlines.

Just seven-and-a-half hours after being voted in as Sweden's first female prime minister, Magdalena Andersson has resigned.It comes after her budget was defeated and her Green allies left the government.The budget proposal was rejected in favour of one presented by the opposition that includes the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats.Sweden’s third-largest party is rooted in a neo-Nazi movement. The vote was 154-143 in favour of the opposition’s budget proposal.Andersson, leader of the Social Democratic Party, decided it was best to step down from the post after she made history by becoming the first woman to lead the country."There is a constitutional practice where a coalition government resigns when a party leaves it. I don't want to lead a government whose legitimacy is being called into question," she said at a press conference, where she said she hoped to be re-elected in a subsequent vote.Andersson, who was finance minister before briefly becoming prime minister, informed parliamentary speaker Andreas Norlen that she is still interested in leading a Social Democratic one-party government.Norlen, the speaker of Sweden’s 349-seat parliament, said he will contact Sweden’s eight party leaders ”to discuss the situation.”On Thursday, he will announce the road ahead.Even though the Green Party pulled its support for her government, it said it is prepared to stand behind Andersson in a new vote to tap a prime minister.But the Greens said it was in the best interests of the party to pull support for her after the budget defeat in parliament.“We have a united party behind us saying we can not sit in a government that implements a policy (the Sweden Democrats) negotiated. We must look our voters in the eye and feel pride,” said Marta Stenevi, Green Party spokesperson as the party chose to resign from the government.
