Today the guidance on day 2 tests was changed by the UK government. We are updating this article with the latest information as we receive it.Many people aren’t travelling at the moment because they just don’t want to deal with all the hassle and expense of COVID-19 tests. The UK’s rules can be confusing, especially as the government often changes them at short notice.But travel is still allowed to and from the UK, so read on to make sure you know the rules, and how to follow them.As of 04:00 GMT on 30 November, this test must be a PCR test. You must self-isolate until you have received a negative resultYou will need your booking reference for your passenger locator form, which can be filled in up to 48 hours before your flight.Therefore, you must book your day 2 test before you arrive at the airport to take your flight to the UKPreviously, since 24 October, an antigen or lateral flow test was allowed.However, this weekend UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that PCR tests will now be required for all arrivals, regardless of vaccination status or country of origin. This is in response to the Omicron COVID-19 strain, which has been labelled by the World Health Organization as a 'variant of concern.'Note that the green and amber lists were scrapped on October 4 2021. The red list was entirely removed in October too, but as of this week 10 countries have been re-added to the list.You can find out more about this here.Despite the name, you can actually do the test on or before day 2. This rule is stated on the UK government website here.This means that you can get tested as soon as you land in the UK. Most airports have testing centres, and getting it done when you arrive means you don’t need to worry about doing it on your actual day 2. You could also do it on the way home from the airport, or the next day. But remember you must self-isolate and only leave where you are staying for essential reasons such as testing.Don’t forget: day 0 is the day you arrive into the UK, then the next day is day 1, and so on.There are lots of different companies that you can book a test through online. But not all test providers are created equal.In terms of private providers, some companies offer at-home options sent by mail, or in-person testing. The government has a handy guide about which test might be right for you here.Remember to make your online booking in time to put the booking reference, which you'll receive by email, on your passenger locator form.There are company you might want to avoid, for now at least.On September 24th, the UK Competition and Markets Authority revealed they are investigating Dante Labs for not delivering tests or test results on time or at all, not responding to customer complaints, refusing or delaying to pay refunds and having unfair terms and conditions. The results of their investigation will be revealed in due course.Don't worry, however, if you are already in the process of using Dante for testing. Your results will still be accepted as valid.The other testing company under investigation is Expert Medicals.They are similarly being investigated for not sending out tests and results, not responding to customer complaints and refusing to issue refunds when due.You can find the list of government-approved testing providers here.The UK’s Citizens Advice Bureau can provide support via their website.You can also email dhsctesttrace.customerfeedbackteam@nhs.net for more advice.Many of our readers have questions about the UK's travel requirements.We put these questions to the government departments responsible for the rules. Their answers are below.According to the government, airlines are responsible for checking that passengers are following the guidance."There is no specific guidance on reporting as this is done by laboratories, but passengers must self-isolate for 10 days if they receive a positive test result," says the spokesperson.Irish and British citizens travelling between the UK and Ireland do not count as 'international travellers' because of the Common Travel Area.At the moment, this guidance has not changed and British or Irish citizens travelling from Ireland into the UK are not required to fill out a Passenger Locator Form (PLF) or take a COVID-19 PCR test.However, non-British and non-Irish citizens entering the UK are likely to still need a PLF and a PCR test.The guidance around this is still changing, so we recommend contacting your travel provider for further clarity.Yes - if you're travelling from abroad you will still need to book a day 2 test, even if you are in the UK for less than two days.You will need to fill out a Passenger Locator Form (PLF), even for a short trip, which requires a day 2 test booking number.If you are only coming to the UK to transfer to another country, you will not need to book a day 2 test - as long as you are only in the UK for transit purposes.If you remain 'airside' only, and do not pass through border control, then you do not need to fill out a Passenger Locator Form (PLF).If you are a 'landside' transit, and need to pass through border control, you will need to fill out a PLF but still do not need to book a day 2 test.Instead you will do the following on the form:These rules only apply to fully vaccinated travellers who have not been in red-list countries in the past 10 days. For more information, click here.Yes, children aged 5-17 need to take a day 2 PCR test when arriving into the UK - regardless of whether or not they are vaccinated.Children aged 17 and under do not need to quarantine, however.There is more information on travelling with children here.
England has added ten southern African countries to their red list and will require all arrivals to do a day 2 PCR test and self-isolate until they have got a negative result.The return of the red list comes after the B.1.1.529 COVID-19 variant, also known as 'Omicron', was detected in South Africa and Botswana.Travellers arriving from South Africa will now have to quarantine on arrival in the UK, along with arrivals from nine other southern African nations.The World Health Organization has classified the new Omicron strain as a 'variant of concern.'From 04:00 on Sunday 28 November arrivals from red list countries will have to go straight into quarantine in government-mandated hotels. This costs around €3,000 per person, for a 10-day stay.The countries added to the red list are:ZambiaAngolaAt a press conference on Saturday evening, UK Prime Minster Boris Johnson said, "This variant is spreading around the world, with two cases so far identified here in the UK.There is also a very extensive mutation which means it diverges quite significantly from previous configurations of the virus, and as result, it might - at least in part - reduce the protection of our vaccines over time. So we need to take targeted and proportionate measures now as a precaution while we find out more."He went on to say, "We are not going to stop people travelling, I want to stress that, we’re not going to stop people travelling, but we will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival, and to self-isolate until they have a negative result.Up until now, antigen tests have been accepted. It is not yet clear what you should do if you already have day 2 antigen tests booked.Unfortunately it is not yet clear when the testing change is effective from.On Saturday 27th November, the UK government said that the PCR test and self-isolation requirement is effective "from next week."They also said these measures are "temporary and precautionary" and will reviewed in three weeks - that will be 18th December.Experts have said that the B.1.1.529 variant could be the most lethal and worrying yet. This is because of its "awful spike mutation profile", which scientists fear could help it evade immunity. Early reports suggest it is capable of reducing vaccine efficiency to just 30 per cent.There are currently reported cases of the variant in the UK, The Netherlands, Germany, South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana.It's believed that officials will now be hoping to track down hundreds of people who have arrived in the UK from South Africa over the past week, in an attempt to avoid introducing the new strain.More than 500 passengers arrive in the UK from South Africa every day.Non-UK and Irish residents are not allowed to enter England if they have been in any of the red list countries in the past 10 days.Any British or Irish resident entering England after 04:00 on Sunday must quarantine in a government-mandated hotel, with those returning between Friday and Sunday asked to isolate at home.Anyone who has returned in the last 10 days from red list countries is going to be asked to take a PCR test by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).Britain has been among the countries hardest hit by COVID-19, with 144,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic.The number of cases remains high - more than 47,000 in the past 24 hours on Thursday - but more than 80 per cent of people aged 12 and over have received a double injection of the vaccine, and almost 30 per cent have had a third dose.The UK government has been widely criticized for being slow to tighten travel restrictions at the start of the pandemic, when it kept its borders open as infection rates skyrocketed.
The Dutch public health authority confirmed Sunday that 13 people who arrived in the Netherlands on flights from South Africa on Friday have so far tested positive for the new omicron coronavirus variant.The 61 people who tested positive for the virus on Friday after arriving on the last two flights to Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport before a flight ban was put in place were immediately put into isolation while sequencing was carried out to establish if they had the new variant.The public health institute said in a statement that testing was continuing on the samples.Most of the 61 people who tested positive were put into isolation at a hotel near the airport, while a small number were allowed to sit out their quarantine at home under strict conditions.Health authorities appealed to all travellers who returned from southern Africa in the past week to get tested and set up a test centre at Schiphol Airport for Dutch citizens returning from the region. The tests are voluntary, and travellers can wait for the results in isolation at home.Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy and the UK  also announced on Saturday that they had detected cases of the new COVID-19 variant.The UK reported two confirmed cases that Health Secretary Sajid Javid said were "linked and there is a connection with travel to southern Africa."The infections of the new variant, which preliminary evidence suggests might be highly transmissible and more resistant to current treatment, including vaccines, prompted Prime Minister Boris Johnson to tighten entry requirements."We're not going to stop people travelling but will require anyone who enter the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self-isolate until they have a negative result," Johnson said during a press conference on Saturday afternoon.Javid had earlier said on Twitter that the two infected people are self-isolating with their households and contact tracing is being carried out."As a precaution we are rolling out additional targeted testing in the affected areas - Nottingham and Chelmsford - and sequencing all positive cases," he added.He also announced that Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola have been added to the country's travel red list, alongside South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe which were added earlier this week.It means travellers from these countries must book a stay in a quarantine hotel.Johnson also said that contacts of suspected Omicron cases will be asked to self-isolate for 10 days regardless of their vaccination status and that requirements on face coverings in shops and public transport will be tightened.The "temporary and precautionary" new rules will be reviewed in three weeks.Two confirmed Omicron infections were also reported by the Bavarian Health Ministry on Saturday.The two infected people returned from South Africa on November 24 and have been placed in self-isolation. The health authorities of Germany's southeastern lander called on passengers from the same flight to report to their local health authorities as soon as possible and for anyone who visited South Africa within the past two weeks to do a PCR test.A suspected case of Omicron has also been reported in the western lander of Hesse."Several mutations typical of Omicron were found last night in a traveller returning from South Africa. There is therefore a high level of suspicion and the person has been isolated. The complete sequencing is still pending at the current time," Kai Klose, the region's social affairs minister, said on Twitter.Italy's Higher Institute of Health (ISS) also announced on Saturday evening that a first case of the Omicron variant had been detected in Italy in a person who had recently been in Mozambique."The patient and his family members are in good health," it said in a statement.The Czech Republic also detected a first case of the new strain on a COVID-19 patient. The woman is hospitalised with light symptoms in Liberec, in the north of the country.They come a day after Belgium became the first European Union member state to report a case from a traveller returning from Egypt.Dutch authorities are meanwhile sequencing samples from 61 passengers from two planes returning from South Africa on Friday and who tested positive for COVID-19.EU member states on Friday closed their borders to travellers from seven Southern African countries — Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe — because of the variant.The decision came hours before the World Health Organisation (WHO) gave the variant, first known as B.1.1.529, its name and labelled it a "variant of concern".The United Nations' health agency stressed that "preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of infection" with experts also worried that the variant's "large number of mutations" make it more immune to current treatment, including vaccines.Other countries to have imposed travel restrictions with southern African countries include Canada, and the US.

Portugal’s new law on working from home makes the European Union country sound like a workers’ paradise.Companies can’t attempt to contact their staff outside working hours. They must help staff pay for their home gas, electric and internet bills, as Euronews Next reported earlier this month.Bosses are also forbidden from using digital software to track what their teleworkers are doing.There’s just one problem: the law might not work.Critics say the new rules are half-baked, short on detail, and unfeasible. And they may even backfire by making companies reluctant to allow working from home at all."The law is badly written and doesn’t meet anybody’s needs," said José Pedro Anacoreta, an employment lawyer at PLMJ, one of Portugal’s main legal firms. "It’s no good for anyone. ... It doesn’t make any sense".In many places around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a prior trend toward the digitalisation of work and more flexible work arrangements.Amid such a sudden and massive shift in the employment landscape, governments are scrambling to accommodate working from home in their employment laws. Those efforts are largely still in their infancy.Many Europeans have stopped going into the office regularly since March 2020 to help curb the spread of COVID-19.Without a promised European Commission directive on how to legally frame the shift to more extensive working from home, governments’ legislative responses have been patchy and piecemeal.During the pandemic, some countries have recommended teleworking. Others - like Portugal - have demanded it. Most EU countries have specific legislation on remote working, though with different approaches, and others are considering it through amendments, extensions, or conventions.As home working grew in recent years, workers’ "right to disconnect" — allowing staff to ignore work matters outside formal working hours — was adopted before the pandemic in countries such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Belgium. It is now becoming the standard.But Portugal is taking that concept a step further, by flipping the onus onto companies."The employer has a duty to refrain from contacting the employee outside working hours, except in situations of force majeure," meaning an unanticipated or uncontrollable event, states the new law.Also, parents or caregivers with children up to eight years old have the right to work from home if they choose, as long as the type of work they do is compatible with teleworking.Fines for companies breaking the law go up to almost €10,000 for each infringement.The Portuguese rules are meant to address the downside of what has become known as WFH.The technology that enables working from home has also opened the door to abuses, such as drawn-out workdays as staff remain reachable outside their normal eight-hour shift. The consequences may include attrition between work and private life and a sense of isolation.But the new law has met with skepticism from those it is intended to protect.Andreia Sampaio, a 37-year-old who works in communications in Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, agrees with the law's purpose but thinks it is too general and will be "very hard" to enforce."We have to have common sense," she said, adding that she doesn't mind being contacted out of hours if it's an urgent matter. "We have to judge each case by its merits".And she believes authorities will mostly only act on employees' complaints - "but people will fear losing their job if they do".Prompted by the pandemic but designed to apply in the future irrespective of COVID-related measures, the law could come into force as soon as December 1.It is largely the brainchild of the centre-left Socialist Party, which has governed Portugal since 2015. Ahead of an election for a new government on January 30, it is keen to burnish its progressive credentials and hoist the banner about workers’ rights.Nevertheless, practical questions abound: must staff be taken off company email lists when their shift finishes and then put back on when they start work again?What about Europeans who work in financial markets and need to know what’s going on in, say, Hong Kong, and have colleagues working in different time zones?What if an industrial machine that can’t be stopped requires the attention of an engineer who’s off? Who is it that can’t "contact" the employee — the department supervisor? The company CEO? What constitutes "contact"? A phone call, a text message, an email?"The devil is always in the details ... but also in the implementation," said Jon Messenger, a specialist on working conditions at the International Labor Organization (ILO), a United Nations agency based in Geneva.The Portuguese Business Confederation, the country’s largest grouping of companies, wasn’t involved in drawing up the new law and thinks it is full of holes.Teleworking rules need to be flexible, tailored to each sector, and negotiated between employers and staff, says Luís Henrique of the confederation’s legal department."We’re treating situations that are completely different as if they were all the same. That’s not realistic," Henrique said. "[The law] can’t be one-size-fits-all".Policing and enforcing the new rules may also be challenging in what is one of the EU’s economically poorest countries. In Portugal, which is notorious for red tape and slow justice, as well as poorly resourced public services, how long will a complaint take to filter through the system and achieve a result?Across Europe over the past decade, the number of labour inspections has "collapsed," according to data analysed by the Brussels-based European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), which represents 45 million members in 39 European countries.The country with the biggest drop in the number of inspections since 2010? Portugal, with 55 per cent fewer checks up to 2018."Ambitious, progressive laws ... run up against the reality that ways of policing them aren’t in place yet," said Henrique.
