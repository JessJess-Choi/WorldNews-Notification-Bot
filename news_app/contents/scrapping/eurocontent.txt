COVID-19 cases are sweeping Europe once again - here is a breakdown of how each country has reacted to the surge.Measures vary across the continent, from a national lockdown in Austria to the United Kingdom where only light restrictions are in place.Concerns over the Omicron new variant detected in South Africa has prompted many European countries to put curbs on travel.The World Health Organization warned in November that Europe and Central Asia could face another 700,000 COVID-19 deaths by March 1.Here is a run-down of the latest situation in some of the European countries.German lawmakers will discuss possible new COVID-19 measures on Thursday (December 2) that could result in the closure of bars.It comes after a top German court upheld measures imposed by the government to tackle all-time high COVID-19 infections. The Federal Constitutional Court found that a curfew and school closures were in line with the country's constitution.Germany has faced a surge in cases, reporting more than 67,000 new cases in 24 hours on Wednesday.Austria's lockdown has officially been extended until December 11 as planned amid signs that the measures are helping to bring down a sky-high coronavirus infection rate.Essential shops that were allowed to open until 9 pm, however, will have to close by 7 pm starting on Thursday (December 2).The country issued the lockdown on Monday (November 22), becoming the first EU country to take such a measure in the face of the COVID-19 resurgence.Conservative Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg has also said that vaccination will become compulsory from February 1.Authorities in Austria said on November 17 that travellers would need to show a negative PCR test upon entering the country. Previously, results from the cheaper lateral flow tests were allowed.Greek lawmakers approved mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for people over 60 in response to a surge in cases.Around 17% of Greeks aged over 60 have not yet been vaccinated.If they do not get the vaccine by 16 January, they risk being fined €100 for every month they remain unvaccinated.Portugal reintroduced tighter pandemic restrictions on Wednesday to contain a new surge in infections.Face masks have once again become mandatory and the country tightened control of its borders.A digital certificate proving vaccination or recovery from COVID-19 is required to access restaurants, cinemas and hotels.Portugal has a high vaccination rate with around 86% of its population fully vaccinated against the virus.Denmark recorded a record number of new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday (December 1), with 5,120 new infections in the last 24 hours.Denmark is offering COVID-19 booster jobs to people over the age of 18, the health authority said on November 26, stating that immunity was declining for people in younger age groups as well.On November 12, Denmark reintroduced its digital pass as it declared COVID-19 “a socially critical disease” once again amid an increase in cases.Until at least mid-December, a valid pass is mandatory in order to enter nightclubs or cafes or to be seated indoors in restaurants.Scientists in the UK have advised that all adults should now be included in the COVID-19 booster jab campaign in the wake of the spread of the Omicron variant.The new variant is causing worry around the world due to the high number of mutations it has, which scientists warn could have implications for not only transmissibility but also vaccine effectiveness.Wei Shen Lim, chairman of a UK government sub-committee on vaccinations, said at a press briefing on Monday that all adults aged 18-34 should now be included in the booster programme.Belgium has closed nightclubs and requires people to work from home as part of an effort to curb COVID-19 cases. The government issued new measures on Friday (November 26) including shutting bars and restaurants from 11 pm.Events held indoors must be seated and private meetings, besides weddings and funerals, are banned.Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said on Thursday (November 25) that his country had recorded an uptick in coronavirus cases and hospitalisations far worse than feared, after reimposing tougher pandemic rules last week.The surge exceeded “the most pessimistic curves” drawn last week by experts, he said in a statement.A new round of restrictions entered into force over the weekend including the closure of all non-essential shops including bars and restaurants from 17:00 to 05:00.Hospitality and cultural venues have to ensure people are seated 1.5m apart, which "means fewer people can be admitted to these locations," the government said.Amateurs sporting events are also not permitted between 17:00 and 05:00 with professional sports events allowed to proceed but with no spectator.A 30-day state of emergency came into effect on Friday (November 26) as the Czech Republic sees record-high COVID-19 cases.As part of the government's anti-COVID measures, all Christmas markets across the country are banned and people will not be allowed to drink alcohol in public places, health minister Adam Vojtech said. Bars, restaurants, nightclubs, discotheques and casinos have to close at 10 p.m.The number of people at culture and sports events will be limited to 1,000 who are vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 All other public gatherings can be attended by up to 100 visitors, down from 1,000.Slovakia declared a 90-day state of emergency and a two-week lockdown following a spike in COVID-19 cases that saw the country’s seven-day average of cases rise above 10,000.The central European country is currently in the midst of the world’s fastest rise in infections, and the measures, which include closing all non-essential stores, as well as bars and restaurants, are meant to help the struggling healthcare system.Just 45.3% of the 5.5 million population is fully vaccinated.France is toughening its conditions of entry to the country. From Saturday (December 4), all arrivals from non-EU countries will have to provide a negative COVID test carried out within the previous 48 hours, even if they have been vaccinated.The country reported another 49,610 new daily cases on Wednesday (December 1), up from 47,177 the previous day. The average taken over a week has shot up by over 50%. Health Minister Olivier Véran has warned that the sanitary situation in the country "is worsening".From 15 January, all adults will need a booster jab at least seven months after being fully vaccinated in order to keep their health passes. From mid-December, people over the age of 65 will need one to have their health passes extended.Some 76.8% of France's 67.4 million people are fully vaccinated, according to the latest figures.The Italian government on Wednesday (November 24) decided to exclude unvaccinated people from certain leisure activities in a bid to contain rising coronavirus infections and avoid financially crippling lockdowns.Starting December 6, only people with proof of vaccination or of having recovered from COVID-19 can eat at indoor restaurants, go to the movies or attend sporting events. Having just a negative test result is no longer acceptable in what was dubbed a "reinforced" or super green pass.A new government decree also made vaccinations mandatory for law enforcement, military, and all school employees, among others. Previously, vaccines were only required for health care workers.Twenty towns in Italy's South Tyrol province face harsher COVID-19 restrictions from Wednesday (November 24) with an 8 pm curfew due to high infections and low vaccinations.On public transport, passengers must wear an FFP2 mask or equivalent.Coronavirus infections in Russia have started to fall but daily deaths remain high.There were more than 31,000 new infections reported on Tuesday (November 30) and around 1,195 deaths.Cases surged in October amid low vaccination rates and lax public attitudes toward taking precautions. About 40% of Russia’s nearly 146 million people have been fully vaccinated, even though the country approved a domestically developed COVID-19 vaccine months before most of the world.The Swedish government has announced that from December 1 a health pass will be required to attend any event of more than 100 people.The COVID pass — attesting that the holder has either been fully vaccinated, tested negative over the previous 72 hours or recovered from the disease over the preceding six months — has so far only been used in Sweden for travel purposes.The government also reversed its November 1 decision to stop testing fully vaccinated people.From Friday (December 3), people arriving from overseas must have a negative test result in addition to being vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19. The government also began recommending face masks for children.New COVID-19 restrictions came into force in Ireland on Thursday (November 18) due to high rates of infection that have put pressure on hospitals. People were told to work from home unless attending the workplace is "absolutely necessary".A requirement for COVID-19 passes (based on vaccination or recovery) is extended to cinemas and theatres, while closing times for all on-licensed premises, including in hotels, will move to midnight.From December 9, unvaccinated civil servants and social workers will be fired, the government said.Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on November 16 that those who receive two jabs of the vaccine will be given a payment of 1,000 hryvnias, or about 33 euros in an attempt to alleviate vaccination reluctance.Statistics on how many people received both doses vary greatly, with reports claiming that it stands anywhere between 20 and 28 per cent.Swiss voters approved by a clear margin the so-called 'COVID-19 law' in a referendum on Sunday (November 28).The legislation, which is already in force, includes a pandemic recovery package and the application of a controversial COVID certificate.Like in many other countries in Europe, this health pass only lets people who have been vaccinated, recovered or tested negative attend public events and gatherings.Cases are beginning to decrease in Bulgaria after a massive surge in October but the vaccination rate is still quite low at just a quarter of the population.There were 2,681 new cases reported on Wednesday (December 1) and 128 deaths.The country has 6,470 people hospitalised with COVID-19 and 717 in intensive care units.Like Bulgaria, Romania has found itself in the throes of a deadly spike in cases in October, but cases have now decreased significantly since the beginning of the month.Protesters gathered in Zagreb over the weekend over tighter COVID restrictions after the government announced plans to introduce mandatory COVID passes for government and public employees, including school teachers.The nation of around four million people has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the European Union, with only 53 per cent of the total receiving at least one jab, and only 57 per cent of the 3.3 million adults fully immunised.From 15 December, people must present a COVID-19 vaccination or recovery certificate in order to show up to work.People who are not vaccinated or who have not recovered from COVID-19 are allowed in grocery shops, pharmacies and other essential shops.Additional sources • AFP
Rare footage of a polar bear chasing a reindeer into the water and killing it could be another stark indication of climate change.After the female polar bear drowns the male victim, she drags it ashore in a move that indicates a change of diet for bears in Norway's Svalbard archipelago.The video was taken by a research team from a nearby Polish scientific station who watched it happen and caught the spectacle on camera for the first time.Retreating sea ice leaves bears stranded on land for longer periods. So, with fewer seals and a steadily rising reindeer population in Svalbard - it appears polar bears are being forced to change their eating habits.The incident is being seen as one of a series of observations that suggest polar bears are increasingly preying on land-based animals to make up for their limited access to their normal diet.In Svalbard, just over 1,000 kilometres from the North Pole and where signposts warn of the danger of polar bears, some 300 sedentary bears live alongside around 20,000 reindeer.There are now indications that polar bears have been hunting reindeer more frequently in recent decades.The facts that bears are stranded on land and that the number of reindeer has been steadily rising on Svalbard due to a 1925 hunting ban have resulted in the unusual phenomenon.Eating reindeer has become a matter of both necessity and opportunity for polar bears.But it is largely being seen as yet further evidence of a changing climate.
The Omicron Covid variant is likely to spread further and poses a "very high" global risk, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday.With the world on high alert, a doctor in South Africa who was one of the first to suspect the different coronavirus strain has said the symptoms of the Omicron variant are mild and could be treated at home.Dr Angelique Coetzee, a private practitioner and chair of the South African Medical Association, told Reuters that on November 18, she noticed seven patients at her clinic who had symptoms different from the dominant Delta variant, albeit "very mild".She treated around 30 patients and said the most common feature appeared to be tiredness.Fatigue was one of the main symptoms her patients were reporting, Dr Coetzee said.Other symptoms were a mild headache, body aches, and a scratchy throat, she told AFP.But she said unlike the Delta variant, patients have so far not reported a loss of taste or smell. There was also no major drop in oxygen levels.Coetzee said a patient at her clinic on 18 November reported being "extremely fatigued" for two days with body aches and headache."Symptoms at that stage were very much related to normal viral infection. And because we haven't seen COVID-19 for the past eight to 10 weeks, we decided to test," she said. It then turned out the patient and his family were positive.More patients came in on the same day with similar symptoms, which was when she realised there was "something else going on".Since then, she's seen two to three patients a day."We have seen a lot of Delta patients during the third wave. And this doesn't fit in the clinical picture," she said, adding she alerted NICD on the same day with the clinical results."Most of them are seeing very, very mild symptoms and none of them so far have admitted patients to surgeries. We have been able to treat these patients conservatively at home," she said.Coetzee said her experience was treating people who are 40 or younger and that almost half of the patients with Omicron symptoms that she treated were not vaccinated.But she warns that the effects of the omicron variant in elderly patients are unknown.So far, there have only been a small number of cases reported around the world. It has been detected in several southern African countries as well as some in the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Hong Kong. There are possible cases in other countries, such as France.But what worries scientists is how quickly the new variant can spread.The first case was detected on November 9 and last week three-quarters of the cases registered in South Africa - about 3,000 after a period with very few infections - are due to this variant.But the main unknown surrounding this variant is its multiple mutations. Some are worrisome, according to the WHO. This is mainly because of the risk of reinfection.South African scientists have said it contains more than 30 mutations to the spike protein, which is the component of the virus that binds to cells. This is significantly more mutations than the Delta variant.Scientists are concerned as the spike protein mutations could make this new variant more transmissible and it’s also possible the new variant may reduce the effectiveness of the available diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines."Depending on these characteristics, there could be future surges of Covid-19, which could have severe consequences, depending on a number of factors including where surges may take place. The overall global risk related to the new VOC [variant of concern] Omicron is assessed as very high," the World WHO said.It said in its report on Monday that it is "a highly divergent variant with a high number of mutations... some of which are concerning and may be associated with immune escape potential and higher transmissibility".According to the WHO, several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as a marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation.The health agency said that using this approach, this variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage.
While our attention was focused on the unfolding global health crisis precipitated by the spread of COVID-19, Europe was sleepwalking into yet another deepening health crisis.The 'Time to Act' Data Navigator, a new tool created by Queen’s University Belfast in the UK and European Cancer Organisation, has uncovered the scale to which treatment for cancer has been disrupted by the pandemic.The aggregated data - compiled from 200 sources in 17 European countries initially - indicates that an estimated 100 million screening tests were not performed while up to half of all cancer patients were affected by treatment delays. What’s more, as many as 1 million Europeans could be living with undiagnosed cancer.Given the nature of the virus, hospitals and medical centres across the continent were forced to delay or cancel treatment and surgeries to minimise the risk of vulnerable and ill people being exposed to the disease, particularly cancer patients.The toll the pandemic has exacted on not just cancer care, but also the treatment of other diseases, is not yet known. However, researchers hope the data will give a fuller picture of what the virus’ legacy will be."While COVID-19 exposed significant gaps in our healthcare systems, the overall impacts of COVID-19 on cancer care delivery across European countries is as yet unknown," said Mark Lawler, a Professor of Digital Health at Queen’s University Belfast and Co-Chair of the European Cancer Organisation’s Special Network on the Impact of COVID-19 on Cancer."We developed a user-friendly data tool that will help to assess challenges and inequalities in cancer care delivery that European countries experienced during the pandemic," he added."The disastrous impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients and cancer services cannot be ignored. Cancer patients cannot wait, and we must ensure that Covid-19 does not continue to undermine the fight against cancer".These are just some of the key insights gathered by the Data Navigator.A two-month suspension of early breast cancer screening meant that the number of screening procedures carried out in April and May 2020 dropped 70 per cent compared to the same period the year before. New diagnoses of breast and gynaecological cancers dropped by half in April 2020 compared to 2019.Belgium was one of the hardest-hit countries during the first wave of COVID-19. The disruption the arrival of the virus caused to cancer services in the country was also severe, with a decrease of 81 per cent in cancer screenings, and a further 44 per cent reduction in cancer diagnoses. Around 11 per cent of cancer patients faced delays to their chemotherapy treatment and as of August 2021, there were still 4,000 outstanding cancer diagnoses to be confirmed.As the first wave of the pandemic hit, cancer diagnoses dropped by 42 per cent in April 2020 compared to the previous year. According to the data submitted to the research team behind the Data Navigator, there were an estimated 93,000 undiagnosed cancer cases in 2020 alone. In terms of treatment, France faced a surgery backlog of 60 days with a 200-day backlog for chemotherapy.For 35 days in March and April 2020, there were no invitations sent out to women to come for mammogram examinations as COVID-19 swept Germany. At the same time, new cancer diagnoses fell by over 27 per cent in April 2020 compared to the year before. During the early stages of the pandemic, 46.4 per cent of cancer patients reported difficulty in confirming dates for investigative procedures like biopsies and surgeries as well as hospital stays.In Ireland, the data is particularly compelling for prostate cancer. Cases detected in 2020 had fallen to 67 per cent of levels recorded in the previous year, with referrals for treatment at prostate cancer clinics in August 2020 having dropped by 26 per cent of normal levels. While detected cases of lung and breast cancer saw only a slight drop to 95 and 98 per cent of previous levels respectively, the number of biopsies carried out dropped by nearly half.In Italy, the majority of patients saw their care disrupted in some way, with 84 per cent saying their course of treatment had changed in one way or another during the pandemic. Some 52.5 per cent of lung cancer patients, for instance, faced delays to their chemotherapy treatment. Women typically waited an additional 4.4 months on average for cervical cancer screening. The number of surgeries also dropped across the board, with the number of colon cancer operations dropping the steepest by a third compared to 2019.In Poland, all forms of treatment were impacted by the pandemic, but breast cancer services, in particular, saw a reduction. For example, the number of mammograms performed in April and May 2020 fell by 94 per cent as compared to 2019.Data from Romania is so far limited but of what the Data Navigator had access to, researchers found that 77.5 per cent of cancer patients had difficulties attending required medical services and appointments during the pandemic while hospital admissions for cancer patients dropped by 61 per cent.Compared to the pre-pandemic period, 38 per cent of lung cancer cases in Spain went undiagnosed in 2020. Screening for solid tumours dropped by over half with 57 per cent fewer cytologies, or screening tests, being carried out in 2020 compared to the previous year while tumour biopsies dropped by 41 per cent. There was a 30-day backlog for surgeries to treat colorectal cancers in 2020.According to data provided by Macmillian Cancer Support, nearly a million people experience some disruption to their treatment because of COVID-19. Breast cancer screenings were particularly hard hit with an estimated 986,000 cancelled appointments, according to the charity Breast Cancer Now.In April 2021, there were 4.6 million people awaiting surgeries with 300,000 of those having waited more than a year to be operated on. Arguably the worst data concerns the rise in mortality, with increases noted across all cancer types. There was, for instance, a 9.6 per cent increase in the number of deaths for breast cancer patients whose diagnosis was made within the last five years.
Existing COVID-19 vaccines are likely to be much less effective against the Omicron variant of the virus than previous variants, the CEO of drugmaker Moderna has warned.Speaking to the Financial Times, Stéphane Bancel said the large number of mutations in the variant suggested that the world's COVID-19 vaccines may need to be adjusted to retain their effectiveness against the virus, should Omicron become dominant."There is no world, I think, where [the effectiveness] is the same level...we had with Delta," Bancel told the FT on Tuesday."I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to...are like 'this is not going to be good'."On Monday, new guidance released by the World Health Organization (WHO) warned the newly-identified and "highly divergent" variant posed a "very high" global risk.However, the global health body also emphasised that there were still "considerable uncertainties" over the impact the variant could have.In a WHO technical brief provided to member states, the organisation described the variant as having "an unprecedented number" of mutations in the spike protein.The spike protein is the part of the virus that is used to invade the body's cells.The high number of mutations in Omicron's spike protein - believed to be between 26 and 32 - is potentially "concerning" as it could make the variant more transmissible and more resistant to the protection given by vaccination or recovery from other variants of COVID-19, the WHO said.This is because current COVID-19 vaccines - both mRNA vaccines like Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech and viral load vaccines like AstraZeneca - work by producing a copy of the coronavirus's spike protein within the body for the immune system to attack.If Omicron's spike protein differs significantly from those of older variants, it could limit the effectiveness of the body's immune response.But in an interview with UK broadcaster Sky, South African government adviser and epidemiologist Salim Abdool Karim said that while there was "very early evidence" of increased transmissibility and re-infection in vaccinated or recovered patients, people should not "make too much of the very early data"."We'll only get the full picture in about three to four weeks from now. But at this point, we aren't seeing any red flags that we need to be particularly concerned about," he said.Last week, German vaccine maker BioNTech said it expected more data on the new variant within two weeks, which could indicate whether or not it needs to update its COVID jab."Pfizer and BioNTech have taken actions months ago to be able to adapt the mRNA vaccine within six weeks and ship initial batches within 100 days in the event of an escape variant," the company said in a statement.By contrast, an Omicron-specific vaccine could take months to develop, Moderna CEO Bancel said."[Moderna] and Pfizer cannot get a billion doses next week. The maths doesn’t work. But could we get the billion doses out by the summer? Sure," he told the FT.Watch the full interview with Moderna's Vice President and head of Europe, the Middle East, Russia, and Africa, Dan Steiner, in the video player above.Additional sources • Financial Times, Sky News
