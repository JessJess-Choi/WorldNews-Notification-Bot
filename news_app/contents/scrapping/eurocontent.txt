Rare footage of a polar bear chasing a reindeer into the water and killing it could be another stark indication of climate change.After the female polar bear drowns the male victim, she drags it ashore in a move that indicates a change of diet for bears in Norway's Svalbard archipelago.The video was taken by a research team from a nearby Polish scientific station who watched it happen and caught the spectacle on camera for the first time.Retreating sea ice leaves bears stranded on land for longer periods. So, with fewer seals and a steadily rising reindeer population in Svalbard - it appears polar bears are being forced to change their eating habits.The incident is being seen as one of a series of observations that suggest polar bears are increasingly preying on land-based animals to make up for their limited access to their normal diet.In Svalbard, just over 1,000 kilometres from the North Pole and where signposts warn of the danger of polar bears, some 300 sedentary bears live alongside around 20,000 reindeer.There are now indications that polar bears have been hunting reindeer more frequently in recent decades.The facts that bears are stranded on land and that the number of reindeer has been steadily rising on Svalbard due to a 1925 hunting ban have resulted in the unusual phenomenon.Eating reindeer has become a matter of both necessity and opportunity for polar bears.But it is largely being seen as yet further evidence of a changing climate.
All travellers arriving into the US from next week will have to show a negative COVID-19 test result. The test must have been taken within one day of departure.This will apply to all arrivals, regardless of their vaccination status or where they have travelled from.Up until now, travellers had a 72-hour window to take the test.The new rule is part of a raft of measures intended to stop the spread of the omicron COVID-19 variant within the United States.A White Statement said, "Early next week, the United States will tighten pre-departure testing protocols by requiring all inbound international travelers to test within one day of departure globally, regardless of nationality or vaccination status."The new rules will apply to everyone entering the US, whether they are foreign nationals or US citizens.The White House also announced that mandatory mask wearing on public transport will be extended until 18 March 2022.All passengers, unless medically exempt, must wear a mask on all forms of public transport. The mandate was due to expire on 18 January 2022.
France will require all UK travellers to present a negative COVID-19 test from Saturday 4 December.The new rules will apply to all countries outside of the EU, regardless of a person’s vaccination status. The test can be either a PCR or an antigen, taken within 48 hours of travel.French government spokesperson Gabriel Attal announced the new measures as the country seeks to tighten entry rules in response to the new Omicron variant.Until this Saturday, UK and other non-EU travellers may continue to enter France with proof of vaccination and a sworn declaration form.Arrivals from the Schengen zone will only need to present a negative test if they are not fully vaccinated. This test will need to be taken 24 hours before travel.Gabriel Attal also confirmed at the weekly press conference that the travel ban between France and South  Africa would be extended into December.From Saturday, flights to and from South Africa - where the Omicron variant was first discovered - will be allowed to land in France, but under very strict conditions.These will include only allowing French and EU residents, diplomats, and flight staff to disembark and requiring travellers to have a COVID-19 test upon arrival before undergoing a seven day quarantine, even if the result is negative. A positive test will require a 10-day quarantine period.According to Attal, France has so far recorded 13 suspected cases of the Omicron variant. "Let's not be fooled or naïve, there will very probably be cases on our territory in the coming hours or days,” he says.He also announced that there had been 47,177 new cases recorded in France on Tuesday (30 November) and that “hospital pressure is increasing markedly”.
COVID-19 cases are sweeping Europe once again - here is a breakdown of how each country has reacted to the surge.Measures vary across the continent, from a national lockdown in Austria to the United Kingdom where only light restrictions are in place.Concerns over the Omicron new variant detected in South Africa has prompted many European countries to put curbs on travel.The World Health Organization warned in November that Europe and Central Asia could face another 700,000 COVID-19 deaths by March 1.Here is a run-down of the latest situation in some of the European countries.Germany moved on Thursday (December 2) to tighten restrictions for those unvaccinated against COVID-19. People without the jab won't be able to access non-essential shops, restaurants, places of culture or leisure.The decision was announced after a meeting between outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel, her successor Olaf Scholz and the leaders of the country's 16 regions.A draft law on mandatory vaccination is to be submitted to parliament for entry into force in February or March.Masks are to be required in schools, and new limits imposed on private meetings.The moves follow a ruling from a top German court upholding government measurres to tackle all-time high COVID-19 infections. The Federal Constitutional Court found that a curfew and school closures were in line with the country's constitution.Scientists and doctors have warned that medical services in Germany could become overstretched in the coming weeks unless drastic action is taken. Some hospitals in the south and east have already transferred patients to other parts of the country.Germany reported more than 67,000 new cases in 24 hours on Wednesday (December 1). The country has vaccinated 68.% of its population and 80% of adults.Austria's lockdown has officially been extended until December 11 as planned amid signs that the measures are helping to bring down a sky-high coronavirus infection rate.Essential shops that were allowed to open until 9 pm, however, will have to close by 7 pm starting on Thursday (December 2).The country issued the lockdown on Monday (November 22), becoming the first EU country to take such a measure in the face of the COVID-19 resurgence.Conservative Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg has also said that vaccination will become compulsory from February 1.Authorities in Austria said on November 17 that travellers would need to show a negative PCR test upon entering the country. Previously, results from the cheaper lateral flow tests were allowed.Greek lawmakers approved mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for people over 60 in response to a surge in cases.Around 17% of Greeks aged over 60 have not yet been vaccinated.If they do not get the vaccine by 16 January, they risk being fined €100 for every month they remain unvaccinated.Portugal reintroduced tighter pandemic restrictions on Wednesday (December 1) to contain a new surge in infections.Face masks have once again become mandatory and the country tightened control of its borders.A digital certificate proving vaccination or recovery from COVID-19 is required to access restaurants, cinemas and hotels.Portugal has a high vaccination rate with around 86% of its population fully vaccinated against the virus.France is toughening its conditions of entry. From Saturday (December 4), all arrivals from non-EU countries will have to provide a negative COVID test carried out within the previous 48 hours, even if they have been vaccinated.The country reported another 49,610 new daily cases on Wednesday (December 1), up from 47,177 the previous day.

They include working from home when possible, a 100-person attendance limit at private indoor events in public places or rented venues, and restaurants and bars having to register customers.An outbreak of infections linked to a Christmas party sparked fears over the Omicron variant. Around half of some 120 people present tested positive -- even though they were reportedly all vaccinated.The authorities recommend the use of face masks on public transportation and in shops and shopping malls.Anyone entering Norway must be tested within 24 hours, either at the border, at a public test station or by self-test. If a rapid test comes back positive, a traveller must take a PCR test within 24 hours.From Friday (December 3), people arriving from overseas must have a negative test result in addition to being vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19. The government also began recommending face masks for children.New COVID-19 restrictions came into force in Ireland on Thursday (November 18) due to high rates of infection that have put pressure on hospitals. People were told to work from home unless attending the workplace is "absolutely necessary".A requirement for COVID-19 passes (based on vaccination or recovery) is extended to cinemas and theatres, while closing times for all on-licensed premises, including in hotels, will move to midnight.From December 9, unvaccinated civil servants and social workers will be fired, the government said.Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on November 16 that those who receive two jabs of the vaccine will be given a payment of 1,000 hryvnias, or about 33 euros in an attempt to alleviate vaccination reluctance.Statistics on how many people received both doses vary greatly, with reports claiming that it stands anywhere between 20 and 28 per cent.Swiss voters approved by a clear margin the so-called 'COVID-19 law' in a referendum on Sunday (November 28).The legislation, which is already in force, includes a pandemic recovery package and the application of a controversial COVID certificate.Like in many other countries in Europe, this health pass only lets people who have been vaccinated, recovered or tested negative attend public events and gatherings.Cases are beginning to decrease in Bulgaria after a massive surge in October but the vaccination rate is still quite low at just a quarter of the population.There were 2,681 new cases reported on Wednesday (December 1) and 128 deaths.The country has 6,470 people hospitalised with COVID-19 and 717 in intensive care units.Like Bulgaria, Romania has found itself in the throes of a deadly spike in cases in October, but cases have now decreased significantly since the beginning of the month.Protesters gathered in Zagreb over the weekend over tighter COVID restrictions after the government announced plans to introduce mandatory COVID passes for government and public employees, including school teachers.The nation of around four million people has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the European Union, with only 53 per cent of the total receiving at least one jab, and only 57 per cent of the 3.3 million adults fully immunised.From 15 December, people must present a COVID-19 vaccination or recovery certificate in order to show up to work.People who are not vaccinated or who have not recovered from COVID-19 are allowed in grocery shops, pharmacies and other essential shops.Additional sources • AFP
Scientists believe they may have the answer as to why some coronavirus vaccines are associated with extremely rare cases of blood clots.In a peer-reviewed paper published in the international journal Science Advances on Wednesday, the team behind the research say they think they have pinpointed a "molecular mechanism" behind the clots linked to adenovirus vaccines, such as AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.A number of European countries halted the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine earlier this year due to reports of rare blood clotting events, while earlier this week Slovenia stopped the use of Johnson & Johnson for good following the death of a 20-year-old woman in September.A team of researchers from Arizona State University and Cardiff University says the rare blood clot condition, termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), "only happens in extremely rare cases because a chain of complex events needs to take place to trigger this ultra-rare side effect".The paper explains that the cause of VITT in extremely rare cases could be down to the adenovirus used in the vaccines - which carries genetic information into cells - and the immune response to this."We hope our findings can be used to better understand the rare side effects of these new vaccines – and potentially to design new and improved vaccines to turn the tide on this global pandemic," Professor Alan Parker, an expert in the use of adenoviruses for medical applications from Cardiff University’s School of Medicine, said.They believe the use of the ChAdOx1 adenovirus - used in the AstraZeneca vaccine to deliver genetic information into cells - could hold the key.The team hypothesised that in rare cases the adenovirus may then bind to a certain protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4), which triggers an immune reaction. That reaction leads to antibodies binding to the protein, causing them to cluster, and in extremely rare cases, cause VITT."It’s really critical to fully investigate the vector-host interactions of the vaccine at a mechanistic level," said Abhishek Singharoy, an Arizona State University scientist and corresponding author of the study."This will assist in understanding both how the vaccine generates immunity, and how it may lead to any rare adverse events, such as VITT"."VITT only happens in extremely rare cases because a chain of complex events needs to take place to trigger this ultra-rare side effect," Parker added."Our data confirms PF4 can bind to adenoviruses, an important step in unravelling the mechanism underlying VITT. Establishing a mechanism could help to prevent and treat this disorder".
