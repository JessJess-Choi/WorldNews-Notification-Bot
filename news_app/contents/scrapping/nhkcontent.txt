South Korea's daily tally of coronavirus infections has topped 4,000 for the first time. The prime minister suggested that emergency anti-coronavirus restrictions may be re-imposed.The South Korean government confirmed 4,115 new cases on Tuesday. The figure was more than 800 higher than its previous daily record on November 17.The number of critically ill patients also hit an all-time high of 586.The occupancy rate of hospital intensive care units surpassed 80 percent in the capital Seoul and surrounding areas, where infections are concentrated.The government described the risk level in the greater Seoul area as "very high," topping a five-tier scale.South Koreans started to resume daily activities at the beginning of this month, when the government eased anti-coronavirus restrictions. The vaccination rate stands at 79.1 percent.Experts partly attribute the spike in infections to a growing number of cases among elderly people who were inoculated at an early stage as well as unvaccinated children.Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said on Wednesday that in areas around the capital, the situation was critical enough to consider immediately implementing an emergency plan.
The economy recorded negative growth in the July-to-September period, due to subdued personal consumption, limited exports, and slowed production. These are all factors Kishida plans to tackle in his stimulus package, which includes measures both for immediate relief, such as subsidies to offset rising gasoline prices, and long-term growth, such as aid to companies that invest in semiconductor production.But some experts are asking whether the stimulus will have wide-ranging effects on the economy. The latest GDP data was disappointing, but other indicators give reason for optimism. The October consumption index, conducted by credit card company JCB and data analysis firm Nowcast, shows that spending for the month rose above pre-pandemic levels for the first time in nearly a year. The end of the government's coronavirus state of emergency seems to have people spending again."The government raised the consumption tax in 2019 and people want to know if this stimulus package is what their money should be spent on," said Kumano Hideo, Executive Chief Economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. "Kishida needs to explain that these policies are worth it."There are other concerns regarding specific elements of the package. One of its most notable features is the return of the "Go To" domestic travel subsidy campaign. While tourism and sightseeing businesses welcome the move, critics say people who have been largely confined to their homes for months are likely to spend on travel and accommodation without government encouragement.Another point of controversy surrounds the plan for payouts to children aged 18 or younger. The goal is to support low-income families, with a cap preventing the subsidies from going to households that earn above a certain threshold. The plan is to base this cap on the salary of the highest earning member of the family, but lawmakers are split on whether there are more accurate metrics."The policy doesn't make much sense in its current form because the cap means families with high total incomes will still be eligible," said Kumano of Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. "It would be better to give the subsidies to single-parent households."The issue has even led to fierce debate within Kishida's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. With an upper house election looming next year, the issue could have political implications on Kishida's government if it lingers.Most projections show Japan's economy picking up in the October-to-December period and returning to positive growth. Many experts believe that while the government needs to help the people desperately in need, its main priority should be on drawing up a plan for more stable and long-term growth that lasts years, not months.

A coalition deal reached in Germany after two months of discussions is poised to have the Social Democratic Party's Olaf Scholz replace Chancellor Angela Merkel.In September's federal election, the center-left Social Democrats won most seats, followed by the center-right alliance of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union.Failing to win a majority, the SDP had been negotiating coalition talks with the environmentalist Greens and pro-business Free Democratic Party, which took third and fourth place, respectively.The representatives of the three parties jointly met reporters on Wednesday to announce they have reached a deal to form a coalition government.With the announcement, Scholz, who is currently finance minister, is expected to succeed Merkel to bring an end to her 16-year leadership.The three parties have agreed to raise the minimum hourly wage to 12 euros. They seek to bring forward the deadline for ending the use of coal-fueled power from 2038 to 2030.On the diplomatic front, the new government is to take up what it calls China's human rights abuses.The coalition has been dubbed a "traffic light" owing to their party colors of red, green and yellow.Scholz expressed hopes that the traffic light alliance will play a "groundbreaking role" for Germany, "providing the right orientation and ensuring that everyone moves forward safely and smoothly."
