The verdict, delivered by nine White women, two White men and one Black man, came after more than 11 hours of deliberation spanning two days. It followed eight days of testimony, involving 23 witnesses.Ahmaud Arbery killing trial: Live updatesArbery's parents appeared alongside civil rights stalwarts outside the courthouse following the verdict. They praised the prosecution and supporters who joined the family in their fight for justice for their son, whose killing drew national outrage and helped cast a spotlight on other racially driven crimes around the country.The defendants each faced the same nine counts, and verdicts were as follows:• Travis McMichael, who fatally shot Arbery, is guilty on all charges: malice murder, four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit a felony;• His father, Gregory McMichael, who rode armed in the bed of a pickup as his son pursued Arbery, is not guilty of malice murder but guilty on the other eight charges.• And William "Roddie" Bryan Jr., a neighbor who joined the pursuit and filmed Arbery's final moments, is guilty of  three counts of felony murder, one count of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit a felony. Bryan was cleared on the charge of malice murder, felony murder involving aggravated assault with a firearm and the count of aggravated assault with a firearm.Their attorneys have said they will appeal.Introduced by the Rev. Al Sharpton and civil rights attorneys S. Lee Merritt and Ben Crump, Arbery's parents, Wanda Cooper-Jones and Marcus Arbery, heartily thanked the crowd. Ahmaud Arbery can now rest in peace, Cooper-Jones said."I just want to say thank you guys," she said. "It's been a long fight. It's been a hard fight, but God is good. ... I never thought this day would come, but God is good, and I just want to tell everybody thank you, thank you for those who marched, those who prayed."She later told CNN's Jim Acosta that the verdict "means a lot. It means that my prayers have been answered."It was a very good day, she told Acosta on "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.""To hear that the accused murderers were actually found guilty, I mean, that was huge," she said. "We finally got the justice for Ahmaud that he deserved back in 2020."She said she always believed God would bring justice."Like I said in the very beginning, God has never failed me. He's never failed me," she said. "And I knew that he would not begin to fail me now. So I knew that we would get a guilty verdict. I didn't know when, but I knew that it would come eventually."Marcus Arbery also gave thanks when he spoke outside the courthouse."I want to give all glory to God because that's who made all this possible. ... It's not one side did this. God put us all together to make this happen," he said.Sharpton said a prayer with the crowd and proclaimed with his trademark zeal, "Let the word go forth all over the world that a jury of 11 Whites and one Black in the Deep South stood up in the courtroom and said, 'Black lives do matter.'"Let it be clear that almost 10 years after Trayvon (Martin), God used Wanda and Marcus' son to prove that if we kept marching and kept fighting, we would make you hear us," he said. "We've got a lot more battles to fight, but this was an important battle today."Lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said her team's goal was make to bring the facts and evidence to the jurors."When you present the truth to people and they can see it, they will do the right thing and that's what this jury did today in getting justice for Ahmaud Arbery," she said.Sentencing date has not been setThe sentencing date for the McMichaels and Bryan is unclear. Prosecutors have indicated they will seek sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole.Following the verdicts, Laura Hogue, an attorney for Gregory McMichael, told her client's weeping wife that she was "floored with a capital F" and plans to appeal the case after sentencing.Robert Rubin, who represented Travis McMichael, said he, too, planned to appeal. He described his client as stoic and said he was holding in his reaction following the verdict. Co-counsel Jason Sheffield insisted the McMichaels thought their actions that day were "the right thing to do" and said he is disappointed and saddened by the outcome."We also recognize that this is a day of celebration for the Arbery family," Sheffield said. "We cannot tear our eyes away from the way that they feel about this, and we understand that they feel that they have gotten justice today. We respect that. We honor that because we honor this jury trial system."Kevin Gough, who represented Bryan, said his client was shook when the verdict was announced. Gough repeated his arguments about why Bryan should have been found not guilty."Here he is, he does everything he's supposed to do, he's fully cooperating, he's done everything that he can and now he's looking at spending the rest of his life in prison," Gough told reporters. "Anybody in that position would be disappointed, would be hurt, would be shocked."Gough said he will file an appeal asking for the conviction to be overturned.The McMichaels and Bryan have been indicted on federal hate crime charges and are scheduled to go on trial in February on counts of interference of rights and attempted kidnapping. The McMichaels each face an additional charge of using, carrying, brandishing and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. The men have pleaded not guilty.Arbery's mother has filed civil claims against the McMichaels, Bryan and police and prosecutorial officials.The McMichaels and Bryan were arrested last year several weeks after the shooting of Arbery in the Satilla Shores neighborhood outside Brunswick, Georgia, on February 23, 2020.The men said they believed Arbery had committed a crime. Evidence introduced in the trial showed the men chased Arbery through the streets as he repeatedly tried to elude them. The McMichaels, who were armed, were in one vehicle, while Bryan, who joined while the chase was underway, followed in his own truck, assisting in and recording the chase. Arbery was unarmed and on foot.Video of the killing showed Travis McMichael exit his truck and confront Arbery before fatally shooting him as the two tussled. McMichael's father watched from the bed of the truck.The men pleaded not guilty, with the McMichaels claiming they were conducting a citizen's arrest and acting in self-defense, and Bryan saying he took no part in the killing.Arbery was on a jog -- a common pastime, according to those who knew him -- when the McMichaels grabbed their guns and pursued him. Gregory McMichael, a former police officer and ex-investigator in the county prosecutor's office, told authorities Arbery and his son had struggled over his son's shotgun and Travis shot Arbery after he was attacked, according to a police report.On the stand, Travis McMichael echoed his dad's claim that he acted in self-defense after Arbery grabbed his shotgun. Cross-examined by a prosecutor, Travis McMichael conceded that he'd told investigators he didn't know whether Arbery grabbed the weapon and that neither he nor his dad had mentioned a citizen's arrest to police. His father and Bryan declined to testify.Travis McMichael said he was "scattered," traumatized and "mixed up" in the hours after the shooting, offering an explanation for his inconsistencies.Two prosecutors initially instructed Glynn County police not to make arrests in the case, but about two months after the shooting, a copy of Bryan's video of the killing surfaced publicly, sparking a nationwide outcry.In May 2020, CNN spoke to Alan Tucker, a criminal defense attorney, who acknowledged his role in helping the McMichaels with the video. They wanted to release portions of the video hoping that it would settle rumors in the community about questions regarding Arbery's death.Tucker said that the McMichaels believed the video would clear them in the minds of the public from any wrongdoing.Scott Ryfun, a local radio personality, said a thumb drive containing the video was delivered to his radio station by a man he later recognized as Gregory McMichael.Ryfun posted the clip on the station's website on May 5, 2020. Within an hour of posting, management ordered him to take it down, he said, but by then it had already started to go viral.Part of a national outcryThe McMichaels were arrested May 7, 2020, and Bryan was taken into custody two weeks later. The case soon dovetailed with the killings of three Black people -- Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, George Floyd in Minneapolis and Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta -- redoubling angst over racial injustice and civil unrest nationwide.The father and son believed Arbery was responsible for a string of recent burglaries in the neighborhood, the elder McMichael told police, but Glynn County police said there had been only one burglary reported in the roughly two months before the shooting. In that incident, a gun had been stolen from an unlocked vehicle at the McMichaels' home.Gregory McMichael also suspected Arbery had been inside a home under construction, he said, but the home's owner told CNN he had surveillance cameras and did not see Arbery commit any crime. He did not ask the McMichaels to take any action on his behalf, he testified in a deposition.Travis McMichael also acknowledged he never saw Arbery armed and never heard Arbery threaten him. Rather, Travis McMichael testified, Arbery refused to respond to him and showed no interest in conversing.A state investigator testified during a preliminary hearing last year that Bryan and Travis McMichael used racial slurs on social media and messaging services, and that Bryan told police he heard Travis McMichael use a racial epithet after killing Arbery. Evidence of the slurs was never presented to the jury."I believe Mr. Arbery was being pursued, and he ran till he couldn't run anymore, and it was turn his back to a man with a shotgun or fight with his bare hands against the man with the shotgun. He chose to fight," Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent Richard Dial said at a June 2020 probable cause hearing.During closing arguments, Hogue made remarks that legal experts felt stoked the racial tensions already evident in the case. She referred to Arbery as a "recurring nighttime intruder" and implied he had nefarious intent when he arrived "in his khaki shorts with no socks to cover his long, dirty toenails."Correction: This story has been updated with the correct makeup of the jury, which had nine White women, two White men and one Black man.
The dramatic move came before Andersson was fully in office as she had not yet had counsel with the King, a spokesperson told CNN.Her resignation follows a budget defeat in Parliament Wednesday, Sweden's Twitter account added, with lawmakers supporting the opposition's bill.The Green Party has also decided to leave the minority coalition government with Andersson's Social Democrats, it said. "The current government will remain as an interim government until a new government is in place," it added.Andersson, 54, said she had told the speaker of Parliament she hoped to be reappointed as prime minister at the head of a "single-party, Social Democrat government," Reuters reported.She replaced Stefan Löfven, who recently stepped down as both the country's premier and as leader of the Social Democrats party.All the other Nordic countries -- Finland, Denmark, Norway and Iceland -- have previously elected female national leaders.As Prime Minister, Andersson was preceded by 33 men. She previously worked as deputy director general of the Swedish Tax Agency, according to her CV on the Swedish government website.She holds a master's degree in economics from the Stockholm School of Economics and has served as Sweden's finance minister since 2014.She is also the second woman to head up the center-left Social Democrats party, according to Sweden's Twitter account.Already facing major hurdlesAndersson won parliamentary approval after reaching a last-minute deal with the former communist Left Party, but her grip on power was tenuous because of the Nordic country's fragmented political landscape.Her predecessor Löfven governed by performing a complex juggling act to secure support from both the Left and Center parties in Parliament, even though they are not part of the coalition government.But the Center Party was worried by the deal with the Left Party and had said it would not back Andersson's government in a vote on a finance bill proposed by three opposition parties."We cannot support a budget from a government which is moving far to the left, which we think the incoming government is doing," Center Party leader Annie Loof told reporters.Löfven, who stepped down earlier this month to give Andersson a chance to boost support for the party before a general election in September next year, said he would not continue if he lost the budget vote.Whoever leads Sweden will face significant challenges. Gang violence and shootings blight life in many suburbs of the capital, Stockholm, and other major cities.The Covid-19 pandemic exposed gaps in the much-vaunted welfare state, with the death rate in Sweden much higher than in neighboring Nordic countries. The government also needs to speed up the shift to a "green" economy if it is to meet its climate change goals.
French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said five women were among the dead, one person had been rescued, and one is still missing. An initial toll said 31 people had died but the minister revised this number down to 27 late Wednesday.Four suspected traffickers accused of being directly linked to the doomed crossing had been arrested, Darmanin said, according to Agence France-Presse.The narrow waterway between Britain and France is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. Refugees and migrants fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty in the world's poorest or war torn countries risk the dangerous crossing, often in dinghies unfit for the voyage and at the mercy of people smugglers, hoping to claim asylum or economic opportunities in Britain.Darmanin said the migrants' dinghy had deflated, and when rescuers had arrived it was "deflated like an inflatable garden pool," according to Reuters"Those primarily responsible for this despicable situation are the smugglers, that is to say criminals who, for a few thousand euros, organize human trafficking from Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa, Asia and who then use these people to bring them to Belgium, the Netherlands, France, especially to cross the Channel and to go to Great Britain," Darmanin said.Migrants once sought to smuggle themselves aboard the trucks that regularly crossed the Channel on ferries or by rail from France. But in recent years that route has become more expensive, with people-smugglers charging thousands of euros for each attempt.So far this year, more than 25,700 people have crossed the English Channel to the United Kingdom in small boats, according to data compiled by Britain's PA Media news agency -- three times the total for the whole of 2020. On Wednesday alone, French authorities rescued 106 people adrift in various boats in the English Channel, and more than 200 people made the crossing.Accusations of politicizing the migrant crisisFrench President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson both expressed horror at the tragedy, with Macron saying his country would not let the English Channel become a graveyard. The two leaders agreed to step up joint efforts to prevent the migrant crossings but accused each other of not doing enough."To the families of the victims, to their loved ones, I want to express my compassion and the unconditional support of France," Macron said in a statement."I assure them that everything will be done to find and condemn those responsible, networks of smugglers who exploit misery and distress, endanger human lives and ultimately decimate families."In a phone call between the two leaders, Macron called on Johnson to stop politicizing the migrant crisis for domestic political gain, saying he "expected the British to cooperate fully and refrain from politicizing a dramatic situation for political purposes," according to a readout of their call from the Elysee Palace.He underlined the "shared responsibility of France and the United Kingdom" to deal with the migrant crisis on their sea border, the statement said.French Interior Minister Darmanin accused Britain of not delivering enough resources to help France combat the Channel crossings."The answer must also come from Great Britain," Darmanin said outside of a hospital in Calais on Wednesday night, adding the resources that United Kingdom is giving France "remains minimal compared to the resources that we [France] are obviously putting in place to put in more police officers, more gendarmes, more cameras, more resources in general."Smuggling networksMacron said France had been working with the United Kingdom for several months to dismantle smuggling networks."Since the beginning of 2021, thanks to the mobilization of 600 police officers and gendarmes, 1,552 smugglers have been arrested on the northern coast and 44 smuggling networks have been dismantled," he said."Despite this action, 47,000 attempts to cross to Great Britain have been made since January 1, with 7,800 migrants saved by our rescue services."The country's sea minister Annick Girardin said French, British and Belgian helicopters were searching for the missing.French Prime Minister Jean Castex described the incident as a "tragedy." "My thoughts are with the many missing and injured, victims of criminal smugglers who exploit their distress and misery," he said in a tweet.British Prime Minister Johnson said he was "shocked and appalled, and deeply saddened by the loss of life at sea.""My thoughts and sympathies are, first of all with the victims and their families, and it's an appalling thing that they have suffered," Johnson told reporters."But I also want to say that this disaster underscores how dangerous it is to cross the Channel in this way. And it also shows how vital it is that we now step up our efforts to break the business model of the gangsters who are sending people to sea in this way, and that's why it's so important that we accelerate if we possibly can all the measures contained in our borders ... so that we distinguish between people who come here legally, and people who come here illegally."He added that the authorities would "leave no stone unturned to the business proposition of the human traffickers and the gangsters ... who are literally getting away with murder."Johnson said it was time for Britain, France and Europe to "step up" and work together. He was due to chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee in response to the tragedy, his spokesperson said.British Home Secretary Priti Patel said in a statement that the tragedy "serves as the starkest possible reminder of the dangers of these Channel crossings organized by ruthless criminal gangs."She added: "We will continue to intensify all cooperation with France and other European partners to prevent migrants embarking on these deadly journeys."Beth Gardiner-Smith, CEO of the NGO Safe Passage International, said the deaths could have been prevented and called for the British Home Secretary to resign."More and more people are risking the freezing, frightening journey across the Channel in small, unstable boats since the government closed safe routes to the UK last year," Gardiner-Smith said. "Choosing to play politics with people's lives, the government has failed to prevent people risking the crossing and this is the result. The government must act now to save lives by opening safe routes."On Monday, France's Ministry of Interior announced it was sending equipment and vehicles worth over 11 million euros ($12.3 million) as part of an agreement with Britain, "to secure the coastal strip extending over more than 130 kilometers (80 miles), from Dunkirk to the Bay of Somme."It added that "the police and gendarmes will have additional resources to carry out the mission of fighting illegal immigration."Last week, 243 people were rescued in the English Channel as they tried to cross to the United Kingdom.
Reeves has once again addressed talk that he and Ryder are actually married, thanks to actual priests officiating the wedding scene performed in Romania for the 1992 Francis Ford Coppola directed drama "Bram Stoker's Dracula.""We did a whole take of a marriage ceremony with real priests," Reeves said in an Esquire video. "Winona says we are [married]. Coppola says we are. So I guess we're married... under the eyes of God."Back in 2018, the two actors talked to Entertainment Weekly while promoting their rom-com "Destination Wedding," and Ryder said she believed that the pair had wed."In that scene, Francis [Ford Coppola] used a real Romanian priest," she said. "We shot the master and he did the whole thing. So I think we're married."Ryder had to remind Reeves that they had done the entire ceremony, including saying "I do.""Don't you remember that?," Ryder asked Reeves. "It was on Valentine's Day.""Oh my gosh, we're married," Reeves replied.
