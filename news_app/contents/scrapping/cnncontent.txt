Essentially, a gene was missing in what would be a normal genome profile of the virus. PCR tests weren't detecting one of their expected targets, a signal that something about the virus had changed.Just a few days later, the same phenomenon was reported at Lancet's Molecular Pathology Department in Johannesburg.Dr. Allison Glass, a pathologist with Lancet, said the discovery coincided with an increase in positive cases of Covid-19 in parts of South Africa.In the province of Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg, fewer than 1% of people were testing positive at the start of November, but this rose to 6% within a fortnight and to 16% by Wednesday.The discovery "raised concerns that we were in for another surge," Glass told CNN. "Our first thought was: There goes our quiet December and a Christmas break."Three weeks later, what the South African scientists had stumbled across would be known worldwide as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.The spike in Gauteng didn't go unnoticed at the Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA). Its director, Tulio de Oliveira, called a meeting for November 23. He told the New Yorker: "We heard from one member in our network that a private lab, Lancet Laboratories, had sent in six genomes of a very mutated virus. And, when we looked at the genomes, we got quite worried because they discovered a failure of one of the probes in the P.C.R. testing."CERI rapidly upscaled testing of samples in Gauteng and found the variant appearing very frequently. Tulio later observed on Twitter that in less than two weeks the new variant "dominates all infections following a devastating Delta wave in South Africa."Origin a mysteryJust where and when Omicron first emerged is still unknown. There is no identifiable "Patient Zero," a first person known to have been infected with the variant.As the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, told CNN on November 30, "We just cannot assess where this originated.""The first cases were recognized and identified in Botswana and subsequently in South Africa," Nkengasong said. But he pointed out: "Identifying a virus, a new strain or a new variant doesn't mean it came from there.""It might well be a consequence of an outbreak, probably in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where there's not a huge amount of genomic surveillance going on and the vaccination rate is low," Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, told CNN in a phone interview.Trying to trace Omicron's origins may be futile if it has already been in circulation for a while.Trevor Bedford, from the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Washington, said on Twitter that based on genomic analysis from Botswana and South Africa, "the Omicron variant likely arose much earlier than when it came to our notice, probably in early October."Kristian G. Andersen, a virologist at the Andersen Lab in California, took a similar view, tweeting: "We can estimate that based on the diversity in sampled genomes and most estimates land ~mid October (with wide uncertainty), so we believe it's relatively young."There was also a sharp increase detected in the viral load of wastewater in the Pretoria area at the very end of October and the beginning of November.Speaking to CNN's Becky Anderson on Wednesday, Michelle Groome of South Africa's Institute for Communicable Diseases said: "Our wastewater surveillance actually alerted us as relatively early to these cases in the Pretoria district."But virologists acknowledge they are dealing with very preliminary information at the moment on the evolution and characteristics of Omicron.Transmitted via travelThe rise in infections in early November may have set the stage for the many cases now being identified elsewhere. Most of the international cases tracked by CNN through the end of November involved people who traveled from or through South Africa or from Mozambique, Malawi, Botswana and Namibia.For example, on November 11, four foreigners leaving Botswana tested positive for the coronavirus -- tests that would later (on November 24, according to the Botswanan Health Ministry) reveal the Omicron variant.Also on November 11, a 36-year-old man from Hong Kong arrived home from a 20-day trip to South Africa, traveling via Qatar. Two days later, while in quarantine, he tested positive. Genome sequencing confirmed Omicron.Several people who traveled home to Europe then infected members of their household, including in Germany and Italy.A CNN analysis of publicly available data shows that some 90% of the Omicron infections so far recorded in Europe involved individuals who had traveled through or from southern Africa.However, sequencing is in many countries quite limited. Only a very small percentage of Covid tests are subject to sequencing, which takes longer than a simple test. Current data almost certainly underestimates the spread of the variant.Not all roads lead to southern AfricaWhile some travelers from southern Africa certainly carried the variant, there are other puzzling instances. One involves a Belgian woman who had traveled to Egypt via Turkey. She arrived home on November 11 -- and tested positive for the variant 10 days later.Several cases confirmed in Canada are related to travelers from Nigeria. The case identified in Saudi Arabia on December 1 was of a traveler from north Africa. And an Israeli doctor tested positive when got home from a conference in London. He had not been to South Africa.None of the nine cases reported in Scotland as of November 30 had travel history, and all had attended the same event on November 20. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that "the lack of any known travel or overseas connection to these cases suggests that there is community transmission of Omicron in Scotland."She also said it was unlikely the cases were a result of the COP26 climate change conference held in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12.It's now becoming clear that, however it reached Europe, Omicron was on the continent for much of November. In the Netherlands, the RIVM health institute said it found Omicron in samples dating from November 19 and 23 -- the earliest of them more than a week before passengers on a KLM flight arriving from Johannesburg were identified as the first known Omicron cases in the country."It is not yet clear whether the people concerned [in the earlier cases] have also been to southern Africa," RIVM said Tuesday.There is so much still to discover about the new coronavirus variant -- how quickly it can spread, whether it can evade or blunt existing vaccines, whether it will result in only mild symptoms for the majority of those infected.For now the Delta variant remains the dominant strain, accounting for 99.8% of the global sequences uploaded to the GISAID database, according to WHO's latest bulletin.But that bulletin also notes that "South Africa, where Omicron was first detected, has experienced a recent sharp increase in the number of cases in multiple provinces, coinciding with the detection of the Omicron variant."In the past fortnight, South Africa has gone from a weekly average of 290 cases per day to almost 3,800 daily cases. On Wednesday, authorities reported 8,561 new cases nationally. Authorities said three-quarters of sequenced positive tests in Gauteng province were Omicron."Our cases are increasing very rapidly, I think probably at the fastest rate we have seen since the start of the pandemic, but it is unclear whether this is due to increased transmissibility of the omicron variant or due to immune escape," Michelle Groome told CNN.WHO's Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said this week that "We still have more questions than answers about the effect of Omicron on transmission, severity of disease, and the effectiveness of tests, therapeutics and vaccines," he added.But the emerging evidence -- albeit preliminary -- indicates that Omicron has a head start. The world is still getting to grips with a new variant of the coronavirus that has already spread to nearly thirty countries on four continents.
The day before Ethan Crumbley, 15, allegedly opened fire on his classmates at Oxford High School, the student met "with school personnel about some concerning behavior," Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said.And hours before the shooting Tuesday, Crumbley and his parents had a meeting with school officials about a different issue, according to Bouchard, who declined to expand on the details of those discussions.During Crumbley's arraignment Wednesday, authorities said they found two videos on Crumbley's cell phone in which he talked about shooting and killing students at the high school.Another piece of evidence investigators uncovered is a journal that was in Crumbley's backpack that detailed his "desire to shoot up the school to include murdering students," Lt. Tim Willis said during the arraignment.Video from the school shows the assailant fired at the victims at close range, often aiming at the head or chest, Bouchard told CNN Wednesday.In court, prosecutors said video from school surveillance cameras showed Crumbley with a backpack, and a minute later exiting a bathroom without the backpack and with a gun in hand.Crumbley began firing outside the bathroom, prosecutor Marc Keast said. After students started running away, he proceeded down the hallway at a "methodical pace" and shot inside classrooms and at students who hadn't escaped, Keast said. That continued for another four or five minutes until he went to another bathroom, Keast said.When deputies arrived, he set down the gun and surrendered.Crumbley on Wednesday was charged as an adult with terrorism causing death and four counts of first-degree murder. He also faces seven counts of assault with intent to murder and 12 counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, Oakland County prosecutor Karen D. McDonald said."There's a lot of digital evidence ... there's video, there's things that have been on social media, but you probably don't even need to see that to know how terrifying it is to be in close proximity of another student shooting and killing fellow students. I mean, it's terror," McDonald told CNN of the terrorism charge.Addressing the first-degree murder charges, McDonald told reporters the accusation "requires premeditation and I am absolutely sure after reviewing the evidence that it isn't even a close call, it was absolutely premeditated."Crumbley's lawyer entered a not guilty plea on the teen's behalf Wednesday during the arraignment. The judge scheduled a probable cause hearing for December 13 and a preliminary examination hearing for December 20. He's currently being held at the Oakland County Jail.Additionally, McDonald has indicated her office is considering charges against Crumbley's parents, with the potential charges stemming from the parents owning a firearm, which McDonald said comes with legal responsibilities like securing the gun properly and ensuring ammunition is kept separate.The weapon authorities said was used in the shooting, a 9mm Sig Sauer SP2022 semiautomatic pistol, was purchased by Crumbley's father four days before the shooting, Bouchard said Tuesday.CNN has pressed the prosecutor to speak on whether evidence was recovered to support potential charges and which charges are being considered. The prosecutor declined to go into detail citing the investigation, but reiterated that an announcement would be made as soon as possible regarding whether charges would be brought.CNN has attempted to reach the parents of Ethan Crumbley and are attempting to identify an attorney for them.Survivors coping with trauma and griefAs investigators continue to comb through details from the shooting, students who lived through the terrifying ordeal are struggling to cope in the aftermath.JaVon Pittman, a student at Oxford high, said he took cover as the incident unfolded. "We put the table at the door, barricaded the doors, and we just turned the lights off and we hid under the desk," the 17-year-old told CNN Wednesday.He called his father while he was hiding, whispering that there was a shooting at his school, JaVon said. His younger brother, Jonte, was also at the school during the shooting and was able to escape."It was devastating to hear a phone call like that," said JaMar Pittman, JaVon's father.JaVon and his father became emotional recalling the fear they both felt in that moment."You try to be there for your kids. You can't be there for your kids, and you get nervous. And for you to be their leader, their father, the superhero, whatever. You can't save your kids. That's devastating," JaMar Pittman said.JaVon said two of the shooting victims were like brothers to him."I was good friends with Justin (Shilling). Me and him used to laugh about everything, we were cool. ... Tate (Myre) was a wonderful kid. He was probably ... the best person that I could probably meet, besides my dad and besides God," JaVon said.Zander Cumbey, a junior at the high school, told CNN that Myre was his close friend with whom he played football."He was a great person, a great leader," he told CNN. "Always wanted to make sure everyone was okay and involved in everything he could."The lives lostThe shooting claimed the lives of four teenagers, the youngest being 14.Hana St. Juliana, 14, was a basketball player at Oxford high."We will never forget your kind heart, silly personality, and passion for the game," the team wrote on Twitter. "Since 6th grade camp you have stayed dedicated to Oxford Basketball, soaking in the game."Justin Shilling died Wednesday morning, the Oakland County Sheriff's Office said. Anita's Kitchen, where the 17-year-old worked, said he was co-captain of the bowling team, a devoted friend and "simply a pleasure to be around.""Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time," the statement said.Madisyn Baldwin, 17, was expected to graduate this year, her family told CNN affiliate WDIV, and had already been accepted to several colleges -- some with full scholarships."This beautiful, smart, sweet loving girl was tragically taken from us all today leaving a huge hole in all of our hearts ... " Baldwin's grandmother Jennifer Graves Mosqueda wrote on Facebook. "This horrific day could never have been imagined or planned for."And Tate Myre, 16, was a football player who had been playing for his school's varsity team since he was a freshman, the team said in a tweet. He was also an honor student."Tate was a great young man with a bright future and beloved by all. You will be missed, Tate," the team tweeted Tuesday evening.
A UK court on Thursday dismissed an appeal brought by Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) against a previous judgment that the duchess had a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding a letter she sent to her father Thomas Markle in August 2018.Meghan brought the litigation against ANL after the Mail on Sunday reproduced parts of the private letter.ANL and the Mail on Sunday previously ​said they stood by the decision to publish excerpts from the handwritten letter and would defend the case vigorously.The court said in a summary of the judgment on Thursday that the duchess "had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the letter.""Those contents were personal, private and not matters of legitimate public interest," said the court. "The articles in the Mail on Sunday interfered with the duchess's reasonable expectation of privacy."In a statement Thursday, Meghan celebrated the judgment and outlined her hopes that it would help to change the UK newspaper industry. ANL also publishes the Daily Mail, Britain's biggest tabloid."This is a victory not just for me, but for anyone who has ever felt scared to stand up for what's right," reads the statement."While this win is precedent setting, what matters most is that we are now collectively brave enough to reshape a tabloid industry that conditions people to be cruel, and profits from the lies and pain that they create."The duchess won her privacy claim against ANL in February when the judge ruled "the disclosures were manifestly excessive and hence unlawful," and that there would be "no prospect that a different judgment would be reached after a trial."However, ANL challenged the ruling and pushed for a trial to take place.In her statement on Thursday, Meghan criticized the publisher for extending the lawsuit and "making a straightforward case extraordinarily convoluted in order to generate more headlines and sell more newspapers — a model that rewards chaos above truth.""In the nearly three years since this began, I have been patient in the face of deception, intimidation, and calculated attacks," she said."Today, the courts ruled in my favor — again — cementing that The Mail on Sunday, owned by Lord Jonathan Rothermere, has broken the law."
"The trigger wasn't pulled. I didn't pull the trigger," Baldwin said in an excerpt released Wednesday from the sit-down interview -- his first since the October shooting.When asked why he pointed the gun at Hutchins and pulled the trigger when that wasn't in the script, Baldwin said, "I would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never."Baldwin also said he has no idea how a live bullet got in the Colt .45 revolver he used in the scene. "Someone put a live bullet in the gun, a bullet that wasn't even supposed to be on the property," he said.An emotional Baldwin visibly fights back tears when talking about Hutchins."She was someone who was loved by everyone who worked with her, liked by everyone who worked with her -- and admired," Baldwin said, adding, "it doesn't seem real to me."When asked by George Stephanopoulos if the shooting was the worst thing that had ever happened to him, Baldwin said yes, "because I think back and I think, what could I have done?"ABC is set to air the interview Thursday night.Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza injured in October after Baldwin discharged a weapon during a rehearsal that contained what authorities suspect was a live round.The incident, which remains under investigation, has renewed calls for better safety practices on sets with regards to the use of weapons.Baldwin has said he believes police officers should be present on "every film/TV set that uses guns, fake or otherwise" to monitor weapons safety.
