['Lukashenko denies the condemnation made by the G7 group of the world\'s wealthiest democracies that he is orchestrating "irregular migration" in an "aggressive and exploitative" campaign -- just as he rejects the European Union\'s accusation that his re-election as president last year, his sixth consecutive five-year term, was a sham.', "Not for nothing is the aging autocrat known outside of Belarus as Europe's last dictator.", '', 'For much of this month, the world watched as weary migrants, some with small children and mainly from the Middle East, were coaxed and coerced in freezing conditions to a forest border with the EU. Their rising anger at not being allowed to cross erupted at times as they hurled volleys of rocks at Polish border guards who eventually spewed water cannon fire back at them.', 'In a revealing interview with CNN last week, Lukashenko\'s foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, exposed the psychology behind his boss\'s decision to launch a frontal attack on Europe\'s borders. "Belarus has shown the dark side of the European democracy," he claimed.', '', 'US President Joe Biden made it an early theme of his term in office, that democracy is under attack. "We\'re at an inflection point," he told an audience in Germany in February. "We must demonstrate that democracy can still deliver for our people in this changed world. That, in my view, is our galvanizing mission."', 'But how to deliver on that mission is something that has yet to be mastered. Biden promised a "summit of democracies" "early" in his presidency, it is due to take place next month, although details are sketchy.', "Biden's leverage is waning among allies, due to diplomatic missteps such as the messy withdrawal from Afghanistan and the AUKUS security pact with Australia and the UK that marginalized France. Meanwhile, autocrats like Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin appear to be exploiting the opportunity to divide, discourage and sow dissent in the democracies closest to them, in Europe.", 'When Belarusian foreign minister Makei told CNN that: "Poland has violated all the possible international legal laws and democratic values," he turned logic on its head by ignoring Lukashenko\'s autocratic practices, such as what some governments condemned as the illegal "hijacking" of a commercial airliner that was diverted to Minsk, and arresting a Belarus opposition activist who was on board.', 'Cynically crying wolf, while wilfully ignoring their own violations is a convenience that autocracies routinely use to cover their tracks.', '', 'On the face of it, how can the EU that champions human rights turn its back on migrants, less still turn water cannons on them? Human Rights groups have criticized Poland for preventing journalists from having access to the border region, and for allegedly pushing migrants who had successfully made it across the razor wire fence back into Belarus.', "It is the caring side of democracy, that values human rights and decency, that Biden and others fear autocracies exploit. At one point last week, Lukashenko's government proposed that Germany should take in 2,000 migrants and Belarus would handle the rest.", 'According to Lukashenko\'s foreign minister, both his boss and Putin were pushing Merkel into some sort of deal. "It was President Putin who tried to contribute to the settlement of this crisis. He had conversations with Chancellor Merkel, he had conversations with President Lukashenko and as a result of these conversations, the phone calls between Merkel and Lukashenko were organized."', 'Whatever the detail of those conversations, Merkel and her EU partners saw through the ruse and refused to play ball. Germany\'s Interior Minister Horst Seehofer later said firmly: "We will not take in refugees. We will not bow to the pressure and say: \'We are taking refugees into European countries,\' because this would mean implementing the very basis of this perfidious strategy."', 'This, it turns out, is not "the dark side of the European democracy," as Makei claims, but the EU\'s reality check on what it sees as Lukashenko\'s lies.', "But will that matter for Lukashenko and Putin? Of course not. They thrive in a hybrid of hubris and confusion where doubt replaces certainty, and besmirching democracy's moral purpose is a victory in and of itself.", 'Exploiting democracy', "While the fabricated crisis has -- so far -- failed to divide the EU, little of what's happened is a waste for the two autocrats, in that it helps prop up their own illegitimate rule.", 'For their home audiences, the whipped-up confection of half truths about alleged mistreatment by border guards and their water cannons is enough to mislead some people into believing that the other side is no better than them.', "Lukashenko is exploiting democracy's core value -- compassion -- by weaponizing migrant trauma to turn the EU's moral strength to vulnerability. Europe's real weakness, that he appears to assess, is not its physical borders but its principles.", '', "But the real pernicious injury of Lukashenko's ruses is inflicted on the heart of democracy itself. To fight off his assault on democracy, the EU is forced into taking a firm stand and rejecting the 2,000 migrants. It is logical, but only borderline moral. It stoops toward Lukashenko's level and treats those desperate people as pawns.", 'It is this often complicated issue that Biden wants us to explore by illuminating what democracy has at stake in the fight ahead.', "Inside the European Union, the main effect of Lukashenko's machinations will be to risk raising the specter of migrants at the border even beyond the pre-existing vexing reality -- a situation that has already fueled populist nationalism.", "At his inaugural address Biden used the word democracy five times in his introduction, and 11 times during his whole speech. It was at the forefront of his mind as he spoke at the spot where, just two weeks earlier, the United States' first attempted coup had unfolded.", 'Looking out on Washington\'s flag-strewn Mall, his words broadcast into millions of living rooms and autocrats\' offices around the world, Biden warned: "We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile."', "It has become even clearer since then that democracy's trials are far from over, both in the United States and around the world. Now, leaders must convert their well-meaning words into actions."]

Behind the vehicle, damage to the center divider was visible with debris strewn across both sides of the highway.', 'Speaking alongside Rashkov, the director of Bulgaria\'s National Investigation Service, Borislav Sarafov, called the incident "a huge tragedy" and offered his condolences to the families of the victims.', 'Sarafov said the bus was one of four belonging to a tourist company from North Macedonia that entered Bulgaria late Monday from Turkey, BNT reported. The bus was returning to Skopje, the capital of North Macedonia, from Istanbul -- a journey of around 800 km (500 miles) -- when the accident occurred.', 'At this stage in the investigation, Sarafov said officials were exploring two possible causes of the accident. "One is a human error of the bus driver, the second is a sudden technical malfunction, which led to the accident," he said, according to BNT.', 'BNT reported that Rashkov added: "There is a guardrail here, which was simply taken away, which means that most likely for some reason the bus went to the right in the direction of travel and came into contact with the guardrail, which was simply destroyed. We heard all sorts of versions, including a fuel leak. I hope it will be clarified very soon and the colleagues from the investigation will do their job."', 'Authorities will also be investigating the stretch of highway where the accident occurred, which is prone to traffic incidents, according to BNT.', '', "'Great grief'", '"This is a huge tragedy," North Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev told reporters in Sofia and expressed his condolences to relatives of the victims, Reuters reported.', 'Zaev said the passengers were all from North Macedonia but appeared to include a Serbian citizen and a Belgian citizen. It was unclear whether the two were among the victims or injured.', 'Zaev said he had spoken to one of the seven survivors who told him the passengers were sleeping when they were woken by the sound of an explosion.', 'He said people sitting at the back of the bus were able to break a window and jump out.', 'Zaev said the passengers were from various communities in North Macedonia, a country of 2 million that borders Bulgaria and is home to an ethnic Albanian minority.', 'In Skopje, ethnic Albanian Osman, 31, told Reuters he had come to the office of the travel agency with his brother and sister seeking information about their parents.', '"We do not know if they were on the bus that crashed or not. We have no information about them. The agency is not answering the phone. Perhaps we will need to go to Bulgaria," he said.', "Albanian Foreign Minister Olta Xhacka said the passengers were from North Macedonia's ethnic Albanian community.", '"Great grief for the 45 lost lives of Albanians from Northern Macedonia during the tragic accident in Bulgaria," he said on Twitter.', 'Bulgarian officials have launched an investigation into the incident, state media reported.']

There was no police pursuit of Brooks leading up to the parade, police said.', 'Police had barricades up near the parade, and Brooks drove through those when an officer tried to stop him, Thompson said.', "A Waukesha police officer opened fire to try to stop the vehicle after it struck pedestrians.

["The Department of Energy will release 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the White House. The release is aimed at addressing the lack of oil supply around the world, but its actual effect may be limited. In 2019, US petroleum use averaged approximately 20.5 million barrels of oil per day and in 2020 the US used on average about 18.1 million barrels per day, according to the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. The EIA reports petroleum usage was lower in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.", 'The barrels of oil involved in Tuesday\'s announcement will not hit the market until "mid to late December, depending on market take up," according to a senior administration official.', 'This release will be in coordination with several other countries, including China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom. Officials believe the coordinated effort could potentially have more of an effect on lowering gas prices.', 'As of Friday, there were 604.5 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Department of Energy.', 'The move comes as the White House faces mounting pressure to lower skyrocketing prices at the pump that are contributing to the biggest inflation spike in decades, causing frustration and anger among Americans.', 'Thirty-two million barrels will be in exchange "over the next several months," the White House said, and those barrels will eventually return to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve "in the years ahead." Eighteen million barrels "will be an acceleration into the next several months of a sale of oil that Congress had previously authorized."', '"American consumers are feeling the impact of elevated gas prices at the pump and in their home heating bills, and American businesses are, too, because oil supply has not kept up with demand as the global economy emerges from the pandemic," the White House said in a news release. "That\'s why President Biden is using every tool available to him to work to lower prices and address the lack of supply."', 'CNN previously reported Biden hoped to announce his decision to release the oil reserves during a Tuesday speech at the White House, but that the timing of such a move was still contingent on other nations finalizing their agreements.', 'The President is scheduled to deliver remarks Tuesday afternoon "on the economy and lowering prices for the American people," according to the White House schedule, just hours before he is set to leave for a Thanksgiving break on Nantucket off the coast of Massachusetts', "Biden had been privately advised in recent weeks that tapping into the reserve wouldn't do much to alleviate the current problems, but some Democratic lawmakers argued it could provide temporary relief at the pump. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was among the Democrats leading the charge.", 'Despite being told the impact may be negligible, the option to release oil reserves remained on the table, given Biden had few others, and officials believed coordinating with other countries could potentially have more of an effect.', 'The national gas price average as of Tuesday is $3.403, according to AAA, which is significantly higher than the average at the same time last year when many people were not driving or traveling as much due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It is unclear how much the White House effort would immediately affect prices.', 'The move may instead largely act as a signal to OPEC nations and Russia that the US is serious about taking action to lower prices after those nations were reluctant to ramp up oil production to reduce prices.', "Biden officials have warned the Saudis for weeks that the US would find alternative solutions if the price of crude oil topped $85 a barrel, officials said, which it did late last month. But Saudi Arabia has stood firm in refusing to increase output and has priced in -- wrongly, in the view of US officials -- the possibility that the US reaches a nuclear deal with Iran, two US officials said. The Saudis' concern is that sanctions on Iran would then be rolled back, allowing the country to ramp up its oil production and compete with OPEC+.", "Given that reluctance, the Biden administration viewed coordinating with the other nations as an attempt to undermine the cartel's control of the market.", '"The thinking has been, we can do this alone, or we can do it internationally -- and the latter would be much more effective, especially when it comes to sending a message to the Saudis," said one senior official involved in the discussions.', 'Biden has taken other actions as well. Last week, the President asked the Federal Trade Commission to "immediately" investigate whether illegal activity by oil and gas companies is pushing up gas prices. That move isn\'t likely to have an immediate effect on gas prices for consumers, but is another example that Biden is seeking to show he is working to bring prices down. The FTC\'s findings could also help in the long run if they find wrongdoing. The oil industry\'s top advocacy group slammed that move as a "distraction."', 'This story has been updated with additional information.']
