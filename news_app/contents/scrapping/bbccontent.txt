Alec Baldwin has admitted his acting career may be over after the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the film Rust."It could be," the 63-year-old actor said in an interview to George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, adding that he did not care.Mr Baldwin also said he "didn't pull the trigger" of the gun during the incident on 21 October in New Mexico."Someone put a live bullet in a gun" he said. "I know it's not me".Mr Baldwin is best-known for his performances in films like Glengarry Glen Ross and The Hunt For Red October, as well as his impersonation of Donald Trump on US sketch show Saturday Night Live.The ABC interview was broadcast in the US on Thursday evening."I don't know what happened on that set. I don't know how that bullet arrived in that gun. I don't know," Mr Baldwin said."But I'm all for doing anything that will take us to a place where this is less likely to happen again."The actor said that during the rehearsal on 21 October Hutchins was directing his every move."She's guiding me through how she wants me to hold the gun for this angle."I'm holding the gun where she told me to hold it, which ended up being aimed right below her armpit."To get the shot, the actor said he needed to cock the gun - but not fire it."The trigger wasn't pulled. I didn't pull the trigger."I cock the gun. I go, 'Can you see that? Can you see that? Can you see that?'"And then I let go of the hammer of the gun, and the gun goes off," Mr Baldwin said.The interview marks the first time Mr Baldwin has spoken about the incident on camera, except for a brief interview he gave to TMZ in October, in a bid to stop the paparazzi from following him and his family.Ms Hutchins, 42, was flown to hospital by helicopter after the shooting - but later died of her injuries. Director Joel Souza, 48, was also injured.According to court records, Mr Baldwin was handed the weapon by the film's assistant director, Dave Halls, who did not know it contained live ammunition and indicated it was unloaded by shouting "cold gun".Mr Halls had been given the gun by Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the 24-year-old armourer on the film.Lawyers for Ms Gutierrez-Reed have said she did not know where "the live rounds came from". That question is now at the centre of a police investigation in the US.Investigators have already obtained a warrant to search the premises of an arms supplier in the US.An affidavit with the warrant says police have been told ammunition for the film came from several sources, including PDQ Arm & Prop.The affidavit says the ammunition supplier's owner, Seth Kenney, has told the investigators the live round might have been from some "reloaded ammunition".He says the ammunition he supplied for the film consisted of dummy rounds and blanks, according to the affidavit.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

President Joe Biden has unveiled stricter Covid-19 travel rules as the US confirmed a handful of cases of the Omicron variant from coast to coast.From next week, international travellers to the US, including Americans, must take a Covid test no more than one day before travel, regardless of vaccination status.Those recently recovered may provide "proof of recovery" documents instead.Mask requirements on planes, trains and buses will be extended until mid-March.Millions of free and insurer-funded home tests will also be made available.Ten cases of the Omicron variant have been detected in the US: in California, Colorado, Minnesota, and New York, and in Hawaii, where authorities say that person had no recent travel history.State health officials have reported only mild symptoms in these cases.The variant has now been found up to 30 countries, according to reports.It is still not clear whether Omicron, a highly mutated variant, is associated with more transmission or more risk of evading vaccines.The US is encouraging all adults to get booster vaccines, amid warnings Covid cases will rise this winter."We're going to fight this variant with science and speed, not chaos and confusion," Mr Biden said at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland.He repeated earlier assurances that the plan "doesn't include shutdowns or lockdowns".Over 40 million Americans have received their Covid boosters, but nearly 100 million more are eligible and have not yet had theirs, the president said.Hundreds of family vaccination clinics will be set up across the country in an attempt to increase vaccination rates among children and teenagers.Officials said private insurers would be obliged to reimburse their 150 million customers for at-home Covid tests they buy, and that 50 million tests would be distributed free to the uninsured through health centres and rural clinics.However, reimbursement for tests does not begin until January, after the holiday period which sees increased travel and indoor mixing.The US and several other countries have banned travel from eight southern African countries. Health experts have said travel restrictions will buy them time to study the new variant.Speaking on Thursday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said five Omicron cases had been detected in her state.A man who attended a convention in Manhattan in late November had tested positive for the variant, officials said.One of the cases was a vaccinated 67-year-old woman in Suffolk County who was experiencing mild symptoms of a cough and a headache, said Governor Hochul. The other four were in New York City.A case confirmed in California on Wednesday and in Colorado on Thursday were identified in travellers who had recently flown back from South Africa.An Omicron-positive individual in Minnesota had recently returned from a three-day anime (Japanese cartoon) convention in New York City.The person in Hawaii, who was unvaccinated and had previously been infected with coronavirus in 2020, had no recent travel history. This indicated that community transmission there had probably already begun, health officials said.The Hawaii case was experiencing mild to moderate symptoms and was isolating at home, said officials.With the rise of the Omicron variant, Joe Biden is back in front of the American people with another set of steps to stop the spread of Covid-19.Unlike his last major action, however, the administration's plan is light on government mandates - perhaps a reflection of the political firestorm his previous orders created and the legal morass that has enveloped them.Instead, Mr Biden is pushing for greater access to testing and encouraging, but not requiring, all Americans to get vaccination booster shots.He also makes specific mention of keeping schools open and children in classrooms - a reflection of the white-hot rage last year's extended closures generated among some suburban parents, who have become a key part of the Democrats' electoral voting bloc.When Mr Biden assumed the presidency earlier this year, he acknowledged the success of his tenure would be determined in large part by his ability to contain the pandemic and return a semblance of normalcy to American life.After some early positive results, the rise of new variants - along with vaccine hesitancy among some in the US - dampened those hopes and exacted an economic and political toll.Thursday's actions suggest Mr Biden knows a return to normal is still a long way off.
Two men in the southern Indian state of Karnataka have tested positive for the Omicron coronavirus variant.One of them, a 66-year-old South African national, had travelled from there and has already left India, officials said.The second - a 46-year-old doctor in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru - has no travel history.These are the first cases of the new Omicron variant to be reported in India.The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Omicron poses a "high infection risk".At a press briefing on Thursday, health officials said the two patients with the new strain had shown mild symptoms.All their primary contacts and secondary contacts have been traced and are being tested.According to an official release, five contacts of the 46-year old man have tested positive so far. The patients have been isolated and their samples have been sent for genome testing.The South African national landed in Bengaluru on 20 November. He was screened at the airport and found to be Covid positive, following which he isolated himself in a hotel. Two days later, his samples were sent for genome sequencing, the official release said.He also got himself tested at a private lab - and he got a negative result. On 27 November, he took a cab to the Bengaluru airport and left for Dubai.Officials said 24 primary contacts and 240 secondary contacts of the man were traced, and all of them have tested negative.Following the discovery of the two patients in Karnataka, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said he was monitoring the situation closely. "Our duty is now to track and trace such strains and their contacts wherever it's found. We are already tracking and tracing international travellers," he said.Six samples from people who tested positive for Covid-19 in the national capital Delhi, and another six samples from the western state of Maharashtra, have also been sent for genome sequencing to determine the variant. Officials are still awaiting results. Several other cities and states are following suit.Starting Wednesday, India announced new travel restrictions for international passengers arriving from "at risk" countries a list that includes UK, South Africa, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Israel.They will be tested on arrival and cannot leave the airport without their test results. Those who test positive will be isolated and treated, and their samples will be sent for genome sequencing. Those who test negative must quarantine at home for seven days and get tested again on the eighth day.Different Indian states have announced different policies for travellers - all passengers flying in to Maharashtra from "at-risk" countries will have to spend seven days in institutional quarantine. Delhi and Karnataka have said all international passengers will have to undergo PCR tests on arrival."We are immediately checking suspicious cases and conducting genome sequencing," health minister Mansukh Mandaviya told Parliament on Tuesday."We have learnt a lot during the Covid crisis. Today, we have a lot of resources and laboratories. We can manage any situation," he added.Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the country's public health preparedness, and urged people to continue following Covid safety norms.Life in India India has returned to normalcy in the wake of low case counts and a steady vaccine drive.The country has been recording fewer than 10,000 new cases daily and has vaccinated nearly 80% of the 940 million eligible adults with at least one dose so far.But the latter has begun to slow and the emergence of a new possibly more infectious variant has raised the spectre of a third wave - a frightening prospect given how the second wave devastated India in April and May as hospitals ran out of beds, oxygen and medicines.South Africa alerted the world to the new variant on 24 November after it detected its first case of Omicron. Several countries have since announced travel restrictions.Initial evidence suggests Omicron has a higher re-infection risk. But scientists say it will take another three weeks to know how the heavily mutated variant impacts the effectiveness of various vaccines.
Scientists believe they have found "the trigger" that leads to extremely rare blood clots after the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine.The team - in Cardiff and the US - have shown in exquisite detail how a protein in the blood is attracted to a key component of the vaccine.They think this kicks off a chain reaction, involving the immune system, that can culminate in dangerous clots.The vaccine is thought to have saved about a million lives from Covid.However, concerns about rare blood clots shaped how the vaccine has been used around the world including an alternative being offered to the under-40s in the UK.It also started a scientific detective hunt to figure out what was going on and if it could be prevented. The Cardiff team were given emergency government funding to find the answers.AstraZeneca's own scientists also joined the research project after earlier results from the team were published.A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca stressed that clots were more likely to occur because of a Covid infection than the vaccine, and that the complete explanation for why they occur had not yet been established."Although the research is not definitive, it offers interesting insights and AstraZeneca is exploring ways to leverage these findings as part of our efforts to remove this extremely rare side effect," she added.There were two initial clues for the researchers investigating the rare blood clots:The vaccines used in the UK all try to deliver a snippet of the Covid-virus's genetic code into the body to train the immune system.Some package that code up inside spheres of fat, while the AstraZeneca one used an adenovirus (specifically a common cold virus from chimpanzees) as its microscopic postman.The researchers thought the adenovirus might be linked to the rare clots occurring in some people. So they used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to take images of the adenovirus in molecular-level detail.Their study, published in the journal Science Advances, reveals the outer surface of the adenovirus attracts the platelet factor four protein to it like a magnet.Prof Alan Parker, one of the researchers at Cardiff University, told BBC News: "The adenovirus has an extremely negative surface, and platelet factor four is extremely positive and the two things fit together quite well."He added: "We've been able to prove the link between the key smoking guns of adenoviruses and platelet factor four."What we have is the trigger, but there's a lot of steps that have to happen next."The researchers think the next stage is "misplaced immunity", but this needs to be confirmed in further research.It is thought the body starts to attack platelet factor four after confusing it for part of the foreign adenovirus to which it is stuck. So antibodies are released into the blood, which clump together with platelet factor four and trigger the formation of dangerous blood clots.However, this requires a series of unlucky events, which could explain why the clots are so rare.These clots, known as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, have been linked to 73 deaths out of nearly 50 million doses of AstraZeneca given in the UK."You could never have predicted it would have happened and the chances are vanishingly small, so we need to remember the bigger picture of the number of lives this vaccine has saved," said Prof Parker.AstraZeneca said the vaccine is thought to have saved more than a million lives around the world and prevented 50 million cases of Covid.A University of Oxford spokesperson said: "We continue to follow with interest any new developments and investigation into potential causes for these very rare side effects associated with the vaccine, whilst being reassured by real-world effectiveness data that the vaccine remains a highly effective tool for combating this pandemic."Dr Will Lester, a consultant haematologist at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, praised the "very detailed" research saying it helps explain the "most likely initial step" in clotting.He added: "Many questions still remain unanswered, including whether some people may be more susceptible than others and why the thrombosis (clotting) is most commonly in the veins of the brain and liver, but this may come with time and further research."The Cardiff team hope their findings can be used to improve adenovirus-based vaccines in the future to reduce the risk of these rare events.Follow James on Twitter
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines being used in the UK as boosters give the best overall boost response, according to a UK trial of seven different jabs.The trial is the first study of how well Covid booster jabs work and justifies the UK's early decision to use these two vaccines for boosters.All the vaccines tested raised immunity against Covid to some degree.Researchers said there were promising signs the boosters would still protect against illness and death from Omicron.To make vaccine supplies go further, even a half dose of Pfizer could be used to boost populations, they added.The trial results are thought to have prompted the UK to order an extra 114 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to be rolled out over the next two years.Boosters can cut the risk of infection by more than 93%. All adults aged over 18 in the UK are being offered a booster jab - usually either Pfizer or Moderna - while scientists find out more about the Omicron variant.Earlier this week, the head of Pfizer said boosters against Covid could become an annual event.In the study of nearly 3,000 adults - led by the University of Southampton and published in the Lancet -  boosters were given about three months after second doses of AstraZeneca or Pfizer, which is the gap now recommended in the UK.Out of seven different vaccines tested, all were found to be safe, and the side effects, including headache, fatigue.All seven vaccines boosted immunity when given after two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca, and six were effective following two doses of Pfizer - but some worked better than others.Overall, the mRNA vaccines - Moderna and Pfizer - gave the best boost to antibodies and T-cells, which are known to be important factors in how well vaccines work, particularly after two initial doses of AZ.The vaccines were equally effective in the over-70s and under-70s.The researchers say they found a strong response to all variants of the virus, including Alpha, Delta and the original strain, and hope this will translate into protection against Omicron too.But they caution that further data will be necessary to work out what this means for long-term protection against serious disease.In people who had received two doses of AZ, the study found a 30-fold rise in antibody levels after a Moderna booster, and a 25-fold rise after a Pfizer booster.After two doses of Pfizer, which offers higher baseline protection, the same vaccines raised antibody levels the most.This video can not be playedProf Saul Faust, who led the trial at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, said: "It's really encouraging that a wide range of vaccines, using different technologies, show benefits as a third dose to either AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech."That gives confidence and flexibility in developing booster programmes here in the UK and globally," he added.On protection against hospitalisation and death from Omicron, Prof Faust said he hoped it "would remain intact" and "be handled by current vaccines".Prof Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, added that it was "great to finally see the data that was no doubt pivotal in deciding the UK's vaccine booster approach".He said it clearly showed that "all boosters provided a lift to at least one aspect of your Covid immunity".The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now being used in more than 180 countries and is thought to have saved more than a million lives around the world.Pfizer is being used in more than 145 countries and the UK was the first country to approve the vaccine last year.On Thursday the UK announced another 53,945 Covid cases and said a further 141 people had died.
