Scientists believe they have found "the trigger" that leads to extremely rare blood clots after the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine.The team - in Cardiff and the US - have shown in exquisite detail how a protein in the blood is attracted to a key component of the vaccine.They think this kicks off a chain reaction, involving the immune system, that can culminate in dangerous clots.The vaccine is thought to have saved about a million lives from Covid.However, concerns about rare blood clots shaped how the vaccine has been used around the world including an alternative being offered to the under-40s in the UK.It also started a scientific detective hunt to figure out what was going on and if it could be prevented. The Cardiff team were given emergency government funding to find the answers.AstraZeneca's own scientists also joined the research project after earlier results from the team were published.A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca stressed that clots were more likely to occur because of a Covid infection than the vaccine, and that the complete explanation for why they occur had not yet been established."Although the research is not definitive, it offers interesting insights and AstraZeneca is exploring ways to leverage these findings as part of our efforts to remove this extremely rare side effect," she added.There were two initial clues for the researchers investigating the rare blood clots:The vaccines used in the UK all try to deliver a snippet of the Covid-virus's genetic code into the body to train the immune system.Some package that code up inside spheres of fat, while the AstraZeneca one used an adenovirus (specifically a common cold virus from chimpanzees) as its microscopic postman.The researchers thought the adenovirus might be linked to the rare clots occurring in some people. So they used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to take images of the adenovirus in molecular-level detail.Their study, published in the journal Science Advances, reveals the outer surface of the adenovirus attracts the platelet factor four protein to it like a magnet.Prof Alan Parker, one of the researchers at Cardiff University, told BBC News: "The adenovirus has an extremely negative surface, and platelet factor four is extremely positive and the two things fit together quite well."He added: "We've been able to prove the link between the key smoking guns of adenoviruses and platelet factor four."What we have is the trigger, but there's a lot of steps that have to happen next."The researchers think the next stage is "misplaced immunity", but this needs to be confirmed in further research.It is thought the body starts to attack platelet factor four after confusing it for part of the foreign adenovirus to which it is stuck. So antibodies are released into the blood, which clump together with platelet factor four and trigger the formation of dangerous blood clots.However, this requires a series of unlucky events, which could explain why the clots are so rare.These clots, known as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, have been linked to 73 deaths out of nearly 50 million doses of AstraZeneca given in the UK."You could never have predicted it would have happened and the chances are vanishingly small, so we need to remember the bigger picture of the number of lives this vaccine has saved," said Prof Parker.AstraZeneca said the vaccine is thought to have saved more than a million lives around the world and prevented 50 million cases of Covid.The University of Oxford declined to comment on the research.Dr Will Lester, a consultant haematologist at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, praised the "very detailed" research saying it helps explain the "most likely initial step" in clotting.He added: "Many questions still remain unanswered, including whether some people may be more susceptible than others and why the thrombosis (clotting) is most commonly in the veins of the brain and liver, but this may come with time and further research."The Cardiff team hope their findings can be used to improve adenovirus-based vaccines in the future to reduce the risk of these rare events.Follow James on Twitter
The Duchess of Sussex has won the latest stage in her legal fight against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday.The Court of Appeal rejected Associated Newspapers' attempt to have a trial over its publication of extracts from Meghan's letter to her father.A High Court judge previously ruled in favour of the duchess in the privacy and copyright case.Meghan said it was a win "not just for me, but for anyone who has ever felt scared to stand up for what's right".In a statement issued after the ruling, the duchess said: "In the nearly three years since this began, I have been patient in the face of deception, intimidation and calculated attacks."She added: "The courts have held the defendant to account and my hope is that we all begin to do the same. Because as far removed as it may seem from your personal life, it's not. Tomorrow it could be you."These harmful practices don't happen once in a blue moon - they are a daily fail that divide us and we all deserve better."Meghan's lawyers told the court her letter to Thomas Markle in August 2018 was "deeply personal" and "self-evidently was intended to be kept private".The judges were told during the hearing that 585 out of the letter's 1,250 words had been republished in the five articles in question.Announcing their decision, the three judges hearing the appeal said the letter's contents were "personal, private and not matters of legitimate public interest".Earlier this year, the High Court had found the issues in the case were so clear cut that there was no need for a full hearing.And on Thursday, judges at the appeal said it was hard to see what evidence at a trial would have altered the situation.They added: "The judge had correctly decided that, whilst it might have been proportionate to publish a very small part of the letter for that purpose, it was not necessary to publish half the contents of the letter."Meghan has won a significant victory in this courtroom battle to protect her privacy.She's drawn a line in the sand. Even if her life is of public interest, she's shown that it doesn't make her public property.It was a high-risk strategy, which could have put her in court facing awkward questions, but the appeal court ruling has seen her winning without that.But it's already come with some bruising headlines - such as having to apologise for having forgotten how information was given to authors writing a book about her and Prince Harry.This might have been an "unfortunate lapse of memory", said the appeal court ruling, but it didn't bear on the fundamental issues of whether such a private letter to her father should have been published.Meghan divides public opinion - with vocal supporters and critics both seeing bias and prejudice on the other side - and this court case is unlikely to change that.But she has succeeded in a legal battle that previous generations of royals would probably have avoided.Lawyers for Associated Newspapers had produced a witness statement from Meghan's former communications secretary, Jason Knauf, which indicated that the duchess had written the letter knowing it might be leaked.Mr Knauf said Meghan sent him an early draft of the letter and had written: "Obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked so I have been meticulous in my word choice, but please do let me know if anything stands out for you as a liability."But in her written evidence, Meghan denied she thought it likely that her father would leak the letter, but "merely recognised that this was a possibility".During the case, it was also revealed that Meghan had authorised Mr Knauf to co-operate with the authors of a book about her and Prince Harry, something she had previously denied.
Health officials say the new coronavirus variant Omicron has now become dominant in South Africa and is driving a sharp increase in new infections.Some 8,500 new Covid infections were registered in the latest daily figures.That is almost double the 4,300 cases confirmed the previous day.Omicron has now been detected in at least 24 countries around the world, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).South Africa was the first country to detect the highly mutated new variant. Its National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has said more than 70% of all the virus genomes it sequenced last month have been of the new variant.India, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are among the latest countries to have confirmed their first cases of Omicron. Others including the UK, US and Germany have also seen people infected by the new variant.Many questions about Omicron remain to be answered, including how much protection current vaccines provide.The WHO has categorised it as a "variant of concern", and says early evidence suggests it has a higher re-infection risk.Earlier this week, countries around the world restricted travel from southern Africa as details of the spread emerged.This prompted South Africa's foreign ministry to complain that it was being punished - instead of applauded - for discovering Omicron.South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa also said he was "deeply disappointed" by the travel bans, which he described as being unjustified.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus later warned that blanket Covid measures were penalising southern Africa.New infections are expected to increase in what is now the beginning of the fourth wave in South Africa, and the national health department says there has also been a slight increase in hospital admissions.Most of the people who have been hospitalised in South Africa had not been vaccinated against coronavirus, according to the NICD.There are no vaccine shortages in the country, and Mr Ramaphosa has urged more people to get jabbed, saying this remains the best way to fight the virus.This video can not be played
Alec Baldwin says he "didn't pull the trigger" of the gun that fatally wounded cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of his film, Rust.The star made the claim in his first sit-down interview since the incident in October."I would never point a gun at anyone and pull a trigger at them. Never," he told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News.The interview was recorded on Tuesday, and is due to be broadcast in the US on Thursday evening.Mr Stephanopoulos described their 80-minute discussion as "raw" and "intense.The journalist described Mr Baldwin, 63, as "devastated" yet "very candid" and "forthcoming", while previewing the interview on Wednesday's Good Morning America."I've done thousands of interviews in the last 20 years at ABC," he said. "This was the most intense I've ever experienced."Mr Baldwin is best-known for his performances in films like Glengarry Glen Ross and The Hunt For Red October, as well as his impersonation of Donald Trump on US sketch show Saturday Night Live.The interview marks the first time Mr Baldwin has spoken about the incident on camera, except for a brief interview he gave to TMZ in October, in a bid to stop the paparazzi from following him and his family.In that appearance, he described the incident as a "one in a trillion episode" and said accidents of this nature very rarely happened on film sets.Ms Hutchins was shot and killed as Mr Baldwin rehearsed with what he believed to be a "cold" - or safe - gun on the set of Rust in New Mexico.It is believed to have discharged when he removed it from a holster during rehearsals for a forthcoming scene.Ms Hutchins was flown to hospital by helicopter after the shooting but later died of her injuries. Director Joel Souza, 48, was also injured.According to court records, Mr Baldwin was handed the weapon by the film's assistant director, Dave Halls, who did not know it contained live ammunition and indicated it was unloaded by shouting "cold gun".Mr Halls had been given the gun by Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the 24-year-old armorer on the film.Asked by Mr Stephanopoulos how a live bullet had made its way on to the set, Mr Baldwin replied, "I have no idea."Someone put a live bullet into a gun. A bullet that wasn't even supposed to be on the property."Lawyers for Ms Gutierrez-Reed have said she did not know where "the live rounds came from". That question is now at the centre of a police investigation in the US.Earlier this week, the investigators obtained a warrant to search the premises of an arms supplier in the US.An affidavit with the warrant said police were told ammunition for the film had come from several sources, including PDQ Arm & Prop.The affidavit said the ammunition supplier's owner, Seth Kenney, had told investigators the live round might have been from some "reloaded ammunition".He said the ammunition he supplied for the film consisted of dummy rounds and blanks, according to the affidavit.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Facebook owner Meta Platforms has removed more than 500 accounts linked to an online disinformation network primarily based in China.The accounts had promoted the claims of a fake Swiss biologist called "Wilson Edwards", who alleged the US was meddling in efforts to find the origins of Covid-19.Edwards' comments had been widely carried by Chinese state media outlets.However, the Swiss embassy said that it was unlikely this person existed.Meta said in its report the social media campaign was "largely unsuccessful," and targeted English-speaking audiences in the United States and Britain and Chinese-speaking audiences in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet.Earlier in July, an account posing as a Swiss biologist called Wilson Edwards had made statements on Facebook and Twitter that the United States was applying pressure on the World Health Organization scientists who were studying the origins of Covid-19 in an attempt to blame the virus on China.State media outlets, including CGTN, Shanghai Daily and Global Times, had cited the so-called biologist based on his Facebook profile.However, the Swiss embassy said in August that the person likely did not exist, as the Facebook account was opened only two weeks prior to its first post and only had three friends.It added "there was no registry of a Swiss citizen with the name "Wilson Edwards" and no academic articles under the name", and urged Chinese media outlets to take down any mention of him.Meta Platforms said in a November report that its investigation into the matter found "links to individuals in mainland China, including employees of Sichuan Silence Information Technology Co Ltd... and individuals associated with Chinese state infrastructure companies based around the world."Sichuan Silence Information's website describes the company as a network and information security company that provides technical support to China's Ministry of Public Security and CNCERT, the key team that coordinates China's cybersecurity emergency response.Facebook said it had removed a total of 524 Facebook accounts, 20 pages, four groups and 86 Instagram accounts after reviewing public reports that centred around the fake Swiss biologist.The persona's original post was initially shared and liked by fake Facebook accounts, and later forwarded by authentic users, most of which belonged to employees of Chinese state infrastructure companies in over 20 countries, Meta said.It added that the operation used Virtual Personal Network (VPN) infrastructure to conceal its origin, and to give Edwards a more rounded personality. It also said that his profile photo also appeared to have been generated using machine-learning capabilities.The investigation into the origins of Covid-19 have been a source of tension between the US, China and other countries, as the source of the virus remains murky almost two years after it was first discovered.This video can not be played
