Sweden's first ever female prime minister has resigned just hours after she was appointed.Magdalena Andersson, was announced as leader on Wednesday but resigned after her coalition partner quit the government and her budget failed to pass.Instead, parliament voted for a budget drawn-up by the opposition which includes the anti-immigrant far right."I have told the speaker that I wish to resign," Ms Andersson told reporters.Her coalition partner, the Greens Party said it could not accept a budget "drafted for the first time with the far-right".Ms Andersson said that she hoped to try to become prime minister again as a single party government leader."There is a constitutional practice that a coalition government should resign when one party quits," the Social Democrat said on Wednesday. "I don't want to lead a government whose legitimacy will be questioned.The speaker of parliament said he would contact party leaders on the next move.Ms Andersson was elected as prime minister earlier on Wednesday because under Swedish law, she only needed a majority of MPs not to vote against her.A hundred years after Swedish women were given the vote, the 54-year-old Social Democrat leader was given a standing ovation by sections of the parliament, or Riksdag.Her election at the head of a minority government followed an 11th-hour deal with the opposition Left party, in exchange for higher pensions for many Swedes. She also secured the support of coalition partner the Greens.Of the 349 members of the Riksdag, 174 voted against her. But on top of the 117 MPs who backed Ms Andersson, a further 57 abstained, giving her victory by a single vote.A former junior swimming champion from the university city of Uppsala, she began her political career in 1996 as political adviser to then-Prime Minister Goran Persson. She has spent the past seven years as finance minister.Before MPs backed Magdalena Andersson, Sweden was the only Nordic state never to have a woman as PM.Becoming the first woman prime minister in Swedish history should have been cause for a night of celebration for Magdalena Andersson, yet the sun had barely set when she handed in her notice.The complexities of Swedish politics mean we can't assume we've seen the last of her, though. If there's another prime ministerial vote, Ms Andersson will probably get voted in again. This is because the Green party has promised to support her, despite quitting as a formal coalition partner. But she'd end up in a vulnerable position at the helm of a fragile minority government, and would still have to stick to the right-wing budget already voted on by parliament.What all this political chaos has underlined is just how divided Swedish politics is right now. We'll have to wait and see whether voters break the deadlock with a significant shift to the right or the left at next year's elections.This video can not be played
This video can not be playedThree white men have been found guilty of killing a black jogger last year in a case that became a rallying cry to racial justice protesters.Ahmaud Arbery, 25, was shot on 23 February 2020 in a confrontation with Travis and Gregory McMichael and their neighbour, William Bryan.The defendants said they acted in self-defence during a citizen's arrest; prosecutors said race was a factor.The men now face minimum sentences of life in prison.A mainly white jury of 12 deliberated for about 10 hours before returning their verdict at around midday on Wednesday.The trio were found guilty of murder, aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal intent to commit a felony.In February the three men will face another trial in a federal hate crimes case, alleging that they targeted Arbery because he was black.Arbery was out jogging in the afternoon on the outskirts of the coastal city of Brunswick in Georgia.The elder McMichael, a neighbourhood resident, told police he believed Arbery resembled the suspect in a series of burglaries in the suburban community of Satilla Shores.Police have said no reports were filed regarding these alleged break-ins, and no stolen property was found in Arbery's possession.The McMichaels armed themselves with a pistol and a shotgun and pursued Arbery, who was unarmed, in a pickup truck through the neighbourhood. Bryan later joined the pursuit.This video can not be playedThe jury heard a 911 call in which the elder McMichael told an operator: "I'm out here in Satilla Shores. There's a black male running down the street."The younger McMichael testified during the trial that he tried to talk to Arbery while the two were still in their truck and Arbery never responded.He got out of the truck and fired his shotgun at Arbery during a struggle. Travis McMichael claimed self-defence, saying Arbery grabbed at his gun.Three shots were fired.A post-mortem examination showed Arbery had two gunshot wounds in his chest, and a gunshot graze wound on the inside of one of his wrists.Gregory McMichael, 65, his son Travis, 35, and their neighbour William "Roddie" Bryan, 52, were arrested in May 2020.Prosecutors alleged that Travis McMichael used a racial epithet and an expletive directed at Arbery as he lay on the ground. The men deny racism.By Aleem Maqbool, BBC NewsIn making their case, prosecutors may have chosen not to overtly focus on the fact that Ahmaud Arbery was a black man and his killers were white, but it is not hard to see why this murder has been widely viewed through the lens of race.Arbery's parents had been upset by the way defence lawyers portrayed their son as having been in the wrong for running away from the armed strangers and for turning to try to fight for his life when they cornered him.The fact that these men viewed Arbery as a threat, though they had no evidence he had done anything illegal; that they felt they had the right to arm themselves and chase him; that when police officers arrived on the scene they comforted the killers, not immediately tending to the young man who lay writhing on the ground; the fact that no arrests were made for more than 10 weeks and only then after a video of the killing went viral, all look to many observers as vestiges of a brutal bygone age.Outside court on Wednesday dozens of people, some displaying Black Lives Matter signs, cheered as the verdicts were read.Arbery's father, Marcus Arbery, was seen crying and hugging supporters."He didn't do nothing," the father said, "but run and dream."He also told reporters: "We conquered the lynch mob."Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, thanked the crowd and said she did not think she would see this day."It's been a long fight. It's been a hard fight. But God is good," she said. Of her son, she said: "He will now rest in peace."Arbery was enrolled at a technical college to study become an electrician at the time of his death.The Rev Al Sharpton, a civil rights figure and cable TV host, said outside court: "Let the word go forth all over the world, that a jury of 11 whites and one black in the Deep South stood up in a courtroom and said that black lives do matter."After learning his fate, Travis McMichael turned as he stood to leave court and mouthed to his mother: "Love you."Prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said: "The jury system works in this country, and when you present the truth to people and they see it, they will do the right thing."Bryan's attorney, Kevin Gough, said his team was "disappointed with the verdict, but we respect it".US President Joe Biden said the convictions showed that America's criminal justice system is "doing its job".But he added that the killing was "a devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial justice in this country".Video was central to this case.The first key piece of footage was a 36-second mobile phone clip showing Arbery's death.That was filmed by William Bryan, who was in a vehicle following Arbery, and it surfaced publicly on 5 May 2020.The clip shows Arbery trying to bypass a pickup truck ahead of him on the road and then struggling with Travis McMichael. There is muffled shouting and three gunshots are heard.The elder McMichael is seen standing in the bed of the pickup as the pair struggle.The clip sparked a nationwide outcry and was swiftly followed by criminal charges.Five days later footage from a surveillance camera emerged, showing a black man in a white T-shirt - believed to be Arbery - at a home construction site shortly before the shooting.He is seen walking on to the site and looking around for a few minutes before jogging down the street.During the trial, the site's owner, Larry English Jr, testified that the man in question had not disturbed or damaged his property during the visit.Mr English said cameras had spotted other people - including children and a white couple - trespassing on his property, but he never authorised the McMichaels to enter his property or confront anyone.Jurors were also shown police bodycam footage from the aftermath of the shooting.
JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon has apologised after saying his Wall Street bank would outlast China's Communist Party.The comments, made at a US event, sparked anger in China, with experts warning they could jeopardise the bank's ambitions in the country.Mr Dimon said: "I regret and should not have made that comment," in a statement issued on Wednesday.He added he was only to trying to "emphasise the strength" of the bank.Academics suggested the quick apology was aimed at containing the fallout.In August, JP Morgan won approval to become the first full foreign owner of a securities brokerage in China.Mr Dimon made his original remarks at Boston College on Tuesday, where he was taking part in a series of interviews with chief executives."I made a joke the other day that the Communist Party is celebrating its 100th year - so is JPMorgan," he said."I'd make a bet that we last longer," he told the event. "I can't say that in China. They are probably listening anyway," he added.It sparked a swift reaction, with Hu Xijin, editor of the state-backed Global Times newspaper, saying on Twitter: "Think long-term! And I bet the CPC [Chinese Communist Party] will outlast the USA."Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a news conference on Wednesday: "Why the publicity stunt with some grandstanding remarks?"Mr Dimon apologised on Wednesday, saying: "I regret my recent comment because it's never right to joke about or denigrate any group of people, whether it's a country, its leadership, or any part of a society and culture."Speaking in that way can take away from constructive and thoughtful dialogue in society, which is needed now more than ever."Global executives typically choose their words carefully when discussing China, where foreign companies have occasionally been subject to a backlash for perceived offences.Swiss bank UBS ran into trouble in 2019, after a remark by one of its senior economists about food inflation and swine fever was interpreted as a racist slur.He was suspended for three months and UBS lost a lucrative financial contract with a state-backed client.Earlier this year, Swedish fashion giant H&M and US-based Nike faced pushback from Chinese state media and ecommerce platforms after expressing concern about allegations of forced labour in Xinjiang.Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University, said Mr Dimon's swift apology was designed to mitigate any damage."Dimon's apology shows the degree of deference foreign businesses have to show to the Chinese government in order to remain in its good graces and maintain access to the country's markets," he said.
Many people in America love Chinese food, but David R Chan is perhaps in a league of his own.Mr Chan, a 72-year-old former tax lawyer based in Los Angeles, claims to have dined at nearly 8,000 Chinese restaurants across the US and counting. Each is archived in a spreadsheet that he has maintained for four decades, along with thousands of restaurant business cards and menus.If one visits a Chinese restaurant per day, it would take more than 20 years to reach his current count - 7812 restaurants.From pineapple buns and pork belly to chicken feet and tea-smoked duck, the Chinese restaurant "collector" documents his food conquests almost daily on his social media accounts.Though his food journey started as part of a search for his identity as a Chinese American, Mr Chan said, over the years it has become itself a chronicle of the rise of Chinese food and changing dynamics of Chinese culture in America.Mr Chan isn't a typical Chinese food critic, and he insists he isn't even a foodie. He has no aptitude for using chopsticks, he said, has given up tea to avoid caffeine and adheres to a low-sugar, low-cholesterol diet.But that has not stopped him.Though he is the descendant of grandparents who immigrated to California from China's Guangdong province, Mr Chan did not eat Chinese food as a child. And when he first tried Chinese fare, he was not impressed at all."The food was not sophisticated," Mr Chan recalled of his first Chinese meals in the 1950s. "We would go to banquets, I'd eat soy sauce on rice, and nothing else."Chinese food was first cooked in the US by Chinese immigrants who came dreaming of wealth during the California Gold Rush in the mid 19th Century. In 1849, the first documented Chinese restaurant, Canton Restaurant, opened its door in San Francisco.The early Chinese immigrants in the US were mostly from Toisan, a rural Cantonese county in southern China. The coastal community had a tradition of sailing abroad but was experiencing bloody ethnic conflict and economic struggles, which prompted waves of immigration to America.By the time Mr Chan had his first tastes of chop suey, there were relatively few Chinese Americans in the US - 0.08% of the total population - most of whom were descended from Toisan."It was like if all the Americans in China were from a small town 100 miles outside of Los Angeles. Very underrepresented," said Mr Chan. As a result, early American-Chinese food tended to be homogenous, had to adapt for local ingredients and catered to an Americanised taste.But things started to change in the late 1960s. As a new law lifted restrictive quotas on immigration from Asia, the US began to receive an influx of immigrants from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, bringing in not only modern Cantonese food but also a variety of regional cuisines from across China.Meanwhile, the American civil rights movement was in full swing, and it inspired Mr Chan, then a college student, to explore his Chinese-American heritage.In the 1960s, he started to dine at Chinese restaurants listed on the local yellow pages."At the beginning, it was just a search for identity," Mr Chan said. "My interest in the history of Chinese in the US led me to eat Chinese food and see what it was like to be Chinese in different parts of the country."Through this, he learnt of the diversity of the cuisine. He had previously had no idea how varied it was, he said.Cantonese food, which is known for its bite-sized dim sum dishes, uses light seasoning so that the natural flavours of ingredients can sing. Fujianese cuisine often features seafood served in a broth - the province lies on a coast. Sichuanese food, meanwhile, is famous for dishes heavy on numbing peppercorns and fiery red chilies.During his long career as a tax lawyer, Mr Chan often sampled Chinese food on his business trips to far-flung states in the US, as well as Canada and Asia.The best place to find the most varied authentic Chinese foods in America is the San Gabriel Valley in LA, a Chinese immigrant enclave, he said, but for dim sum, San Francisco is the best bet.He once had "unexpectedly good" chow mein in Clarksdale, Mississippi, which has a historic community of Chinese Americans dating back 200 years. One of his most disappointing meals was in Fargo, North Dakota. "The fried rice was like boiled rice, and somebody poured soy sauce on to it," Mr Chan said. The town is far from any sizable Chinese communities.Chinese food has become "democratised" in America over the last decade thanks to an influx of university students from the mainland, thinks Mr Chan. Now, any college town will have a good restaurant that can be enjoyed by all.Before the recent boom, the event that put Chinese food into the American public consciousness can be traced to a presidential visit in 1972.The lavish banquet eaten by Richard Nixon with then-Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing was televised live across the US, and millions of Americans witnessed their president using chopsticks and sampling dishes that few had ever heard of. Peking roast duck was on the menu, so were fried giblets and lotus seed sweet porridge.Nixon's visit "prepared for another stage in the development of Chinese food in the US," said Yong Chen, a history professor at University of California, Irvine and author of Chop Suey, USA.Five months after Nixon's "chopstick diplomacy", the New York Times published an article titled "Chinese Restaurants Flower Following Diplomatic Thaw".Today, there are over 45,000 Chinese restaurants across the US, more than the number of McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's outlets combined, according to an estimate by the Chinese American Restaurant Association.And because Chinese restaurants are almost always among the few places open on public holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, they have become the refuge of those averse to cooking the big family meal.Nowadays, Chinese food in America ranges from greasy spoons to sophisticated venues offering a variety of dishes from across China. In major US cities, upscale Chinese fine dining restaurants have also opened doors.For Mr Chan, this trend presents a bonanza of new Chinese restaurants to "collect". He hasn't set a goal for how many restaurants to visit, he just hopes to try as many as possible.In retirement, he continues to visit new venues and keeps a food blog.But one of his followers remains sceptical about his expertise - his wife, who is from China and is bemused that people ask Mr Chan about Chinese food.In their house, she is the cook.
This video can not be playedAt least 27 people headed for the UK have drowned in the English Channel near Calais after their boat sank.The International Organization for Migration said it was the biggest single loss of life in the Channel since it began collecting data in 2014.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was "appalled" by what happened, adding the UK would leave "no stone unturned" to stop human trafficking gangs.Five women and a girl were among the dead, France's interior minister said.Gerald Darmanin also said two people were rescued and one was missing. It was earlier reported 31 people had died, but the total was revised down overnight on Thursday.Four people had been arrested near to the Belgian border, he added, saying: "We suspect that they were directly linked to this particular crossing."On Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to step up joint efforts to prevent the crossings and stop the gangs putting people's lives at risk, Downing Street said.A fishing boat sounded the alarm on Wednesday afternoon after spotting several people at sea off the coast of France.French and British authorities are conducting a rescue operation by air and sea to see if they can find anyone.Mr Johnson said the deaths were a "disaster", adding that it was vital to "break" the people trafficking gangs which, he said, were "literally getting away with murder".Speaking after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting, the prime minister said more needed to be done to stop criminals organising crossings."It also shows how vital it is that we now step up our efforts to break the business model of the gangsters who are sending people to sea in this way," he said.He also admitted efforts so far to stem the flow of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats "haven't been enough" and that the UK would offer to increase its support to France.Downing Street later said Mr Johnson and Mr Macron agreed on the importance of close working with neighbours in Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as other European countries, to tackle the problem before people reach the French coast. ÂThe UK has pledged to give France â¬62.7m (Â£54m) during 2021-22 to help increase police patrols along its coastline, boost aerial surveillance and increase security infrastructure at ports.Home Secretary Priti Patel tweeted that the deaths were "starkest possible reminder" of the dangers migrants face attempting to cross the Channel.This video can not be playedBy BBC Newsnight policy editor Lewis GoodallThe grim truth is today was predicted and predictable.We had been told that many would attempt to cross the Channel overnight due to rapidly worsening weather.But it became clear that the numbers involved and the quality of boats in one of the world's busiest shipping lanes made tragedy inevitable.Politicians on both sides of the Channel have already blamed the smugglers, who are indifferent to loss of life.But there will be questions for both governments.For France on the conditions in the camps, with children living in the woods and streets. And for Britain the lack of legal routes for asylum to the UK, which critics says is one of the main reasons people accept the risk of taking to the seas.I've been told today people were still trying to cross the Channel earlier this afternoon. The terrible weather âexpected in the coming days means people know this is their last chance to make it to the UK for a while.Mr Macron said: "France will not let the Channel become a cemetery."He promised to "find and condemn those responsible" for the tragedy.Mr Macron also called for an "emergency meeting of European ministers concerned by the migration challenge".He said since the start of this year 1,552 smugglers had been arrested in Northern France and 44 smuggler networks dismantled.Despite this, 47,000 attempted Channel crossings to the UK had taken place this year and 7,800 migrants have been rescued, Mr Macron added.A number of people are believed to have reached the UK in small boats on Wednesday, with people seen being brought ashore in Dover by immigration officials.BBC Newsnight's policy editor, Lewis Goodall, said he understood about 25 boats had attempted the crossing so far during the day.It comes amid record numbers of migrants making the crossing from France to the UK. More than 25,700 people have made the dangerous journey to the UK in small boats this year - more than three times the 2020 total.The Dover Strait is the busiest shipping lane in the world and has claimed many lives of people trying to cross to Britain in inflatable dinghies.It is thought at least 10 other people had died in the past few weeks while attempting to make the crossing.Were you in the area?
