At least 46 people, including 12 children, died when a bus crashed and caught fire in western Bulgaria, officials say.The bus was registered in North Macedonia and most of those on board were tourists returning from a trip to Istanbul in Turkey.It rammed a crash barrier on a motorway south-west of the capital Sofia at about 02:00 local time (00:00 GMT).Seven people escaped from the bus and were taken to hospital with burns.Bulgarian Interior Minister Boyko Rashkov visited the "terrifying scene" and said the survivors had been badly burned.The cause of the disaster was not immediately clear. Bulgarian officials described how the bus swerved off the motorway and tore away a 50m (164ft) section of the crash barrier, but it was unclear if that was before or after it caught fire.Pictures of the aftermath showed a section of the road where the barrier had been shorn off. No other vehicles were involved in the accident.The mayor of the nearby village of Pernik said the motorway was in poor condition on that section and there were often accidents in the area.Macedonian Foreign Minister Bujar Osmani told reporters the coach party had been returning to the capital Skopje from a weekend holiday trip to Istanbul.Bulgarian media said the bus had been travelling as part of a convoy of four buses and had stopped off at a petrol station near Sofia about an hour before the accident. The other buses returned to North Macedonia safely.The victims have not yet been officially named, but officials said they included children, and young people aged between 20 and 30.Macedonian TV channel Alsat released a list of names it said were passengers on the bus. Comments by Albania's foreign minister indicate that most, if not all, the passengers were ethnic-Albanians from North Macedonia.Earlier, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said he had spoken to one of the survivors, who told him that passengers were asleep when the sound of an explosion woke them."He and the other six survivors broke the windows of the bus and managed to escape and save themselves," Mr Zaev told reporters.The bus belonged to Besa Trans, a travel company that organises trips in Europe.Within hours of the crash, relatives of people who travelled to Turkey with Besa Trans last week gathered outside the firm's office in Skopje, anxiously looking for information.Dzelal Bakiu told reporters in the Macedonian capital he was concerned for his nephew and had not heard from him since learning of the crash. He tried to contact the travel agency but had not been able to get any information.Bulgaria's interim Prime Minister Stefan Yanev described the incident as "an enormous tragedy"."Let's hope we learn lessons from this tragic incident and we can prevent such incidents in the future," he told reporters as he visited the crash site.The area around the site of Tuesday's incident on the Struma motorway has now been sealed off. Footage from the scene shows the charred vehicle, gutted by the fire.Investigative service chief Borislav Sarafov said "human error by the driver or a technical malfunction are the two initial versions for the accident".Have you have been affected by the issues in this story?

China has said the controversy surrounding tennis star Peng Shuai has been "maliciously hyped up", in its most direct response to the issue yet.Ms Peng disappeared from the public eye for almost three weeks after making sexual assault allegations against China's former vice premier, triggering widespread international concern.She has since re-appeared, but questions remain over her wellbeing.On Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said it was "not a diplomatic matter"."I believe you have all seen that she recently attended some public events and had a video call [with the president of the International Olympic Committee]," spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters."I think some people should stop deliberately and maliciously hyping [the issue] up, let alone politicise this issue," he said.Ms Peng, 35, is one of China's top tennis players. In a 1,600-word post on Chinese social media platform Weibo earlier this month, she said former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli - who is 75 - had "forced" her to have sexual relations with him."Even if it's just striking a stone with a pebble, or a moth attacking a flame and courting self destruction, I will tell the truth about you," she wrote.It was the first time such an allegation had been made against one of China's senior political leaders. Mr Zhang has not responded to the allegations.After sharing her post on Weibo, the tennis player was not heard or seen publicly for several weeks. Her safety became a matter of international concern, with prominent players including Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka joining calls from governments and tennis officials demanding to know she was safe.The outcry prompted Chinese state media to release a series of photographs and videos that appeared to show all was well.Over the weekend, Peng had a video call with the head of the International Olympic Committee, after which a statement from the group said she had appeared safe and well. A state media journalist also posted a video clip he said was from Sunday that showed her smiling and standing with officials at a tennis tournament.But concerns over her safety and wellbeing remain.The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has said the recent videos "don't alleviate or address... concern about her wellbeing and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion".Human Rights Watch criticised the IOC over the video call, saying its "collaboration" with Chinese authorities on Ms Peng's reappearance "undermines its expressed commitment to human rights, including the rights and safety of athletes".This video can not be playedOn Sunday, a rally was staged by a group of Chinese feminists in New York in support of Ms Peng.Event organiser Crystal Chen told the BBC that while the released videos and photos appear to show Ms Peng "physically unharmed", she was "not truly free".
A mediator has ordered Kevin Spacey to pay nearly $31m (Â£23.2m) to the studio that made the hit Netflix show, House of Cards, for breach of contract following sexual harassment allegations against the US actor.The secret ruling was made last year, but became public on Monday after lawyers for the studio, MRC, filed a court petition to confirm the award.The actor has faced several sexual assault allegations since 2017.He has denied any wrongdoing.Mr Spacey, 62, lost his starring role as a conniving politician in House of Cards, and has kept a relatively low profile since being accused of creating a "toxic" work environment on set by allegedly making crude comments and touching young staffers without their consent.He was one of the first major Hollywood figures to be publicly accused of misconduct in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, and as the #MeToo movement was gaining momentum.MRC and Netflix fired Mr Spacey from House of Cards and wrote him out of the show.As a result, the studio said it lost millions of dollars because it had already started working on the next season, the arbitration papers say, according to US media.This video can not be playedMRC filed the lawsuit in January 2019, seeking to recover the costs and arguing that Mr Spacey's behaviour violated the studio's sexual harassment policy.Lawyers on both sides heard from more than 20 people in an eight-day confidential arbitration hearing in February 2020, Variety reports. It added that the 46-page ruling made five months later remains confidential.However, the petition made by MRC to the Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday confirms that a ruling was made in the studio's favour. Mr Spacey and his production companies, M Profitt Productions and Trigger Street Productions, were ordered to pay damages, lawyers fees and court costs.He appealed against the decision, but it was denied this month.Mr Spacey's lawyer has declined to comment to US media.Public allegations of sexual misconduct started to be made against Mr Spacey in October 2017, when actor Anthony Rapp claimed sexual advances were made towards him when Mr Rapp was 14.Mr Spacey issued a statement saying he did not remember the encounter, but that he owed Mr Rapp "the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour".In the statement, Mr Spacey also revealed he would now live as a gay man. He was criticised for linking his apology for alleged predatory behaviour with his homosexuality.A string of accusations followed, including that he groped a teenager at a Massachusetts bar in 2016, of which the civil action was eventually dropped, and that he sexually assaulted a massage therapist in Malibu, California. The masseur died in 2019 before his legal action reached court.Mr Spacey lost several acting jobs as a result of the allegations, but made a return to acting this year, with a small role in a low-budget, independent Italian film directed by Franco Nero.
Parents in southern Mexico say they are being threatened by a gang after their children's nursery won 20m pesos ($950,000; Â£710,0000) in a lottery.The nursery has just over two dozen pupils and their parents were put in charge of administering the prize.Soon after their win was made public, they received threats from an armed group, which demanded that they use the money to buy weapons for the gang.The families say they had to flee their village and have been living rough.Gang violence is rife in Mexico and armed groups often try to recruit locals in their fight with rivals for control of territory.A number of the 500-peso tickets in Mexico's much-publicised "plane lottery" were bought by anonymous benefactors and donated to poor schools and nurseries across the country.The Mexican state organised the lottery after a previous plan to raffle off the presidential plane to raise funds for hospital supplies had been shelved because it was deemed impractical.A list of the 100 winners was announced in September 2020 and published in Mexican newspapers.The tiny nursery in the indigenous village of Ocosingo was among the winners.While the windfall was cause for celebration at first, the problems started soon after news of it spread.Members of the parents' association say that they started receiving threats from an armed group called Los Petules which demanded that the prize money be used to buy guns for the gang, which reportedly planned to attack a rival group in a neighbouring village.The parents refused and instead spent part of the money on a new roof for the nursery.The threats increased this year when the parents decided to use the remaining 14m pesos for works to improve their village.In March, one father was shot at by gang members who demanded he hand over the prize money.Last month, the situation escalated further when the gang reportedly attacked women and children in the village, causing 28 families to flee.One member of the parents' association said the community had lost "cattle, our homes, refrigerators, our corn and bean harvests, our chickens".A spokesman for the families said that they had alerted the local authorities to their plight but that unless the gang  was disarmed and dissolved, they would not be able to return to their homes.This video can not be played
In the turquoise waters of the Red Sea, Israeli, Emirati and Bahraini naval forces for the first time just days ago rehearsed joint security operations with a US warship.It followed a war-game at a desert airbase just north of the Israeli port city of Eilat last month, which sent fighter planes from Israel and seven other countries roaring into the skies.Such drills aim to send a strong warning to Iran, which has recently been holding its own large military exercises, and stress strategic alliances.But they come at a time when many in Israel are worrying about whether this small country could soon feel forced to act alone to attack Iran's nuclear programme militarily.The government has allocated $1.5bn (Â£1.1bn) to prepare the Israeli armed forces for a potential strike against Iranian nuclear sites, and there are near-daily warnings from political and military leaders.I have been seeking out the views of top Iran watchers and analysts on what might happen."Israel has no interest in a war with Iran, but we will not allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons," an Israeli security official tells me. "In light of Iranian progress of their nuclear programme, we are preparing for all options and scenarios, including military capabilities."The sabre-rattling comes as talks between Iran and five world powers (plus the US indirectly) on reviving the 2015 nuclear deal - known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - are due to resume in the Austrian capital Vienna on 29 November.The JCPOA limited Iran's nuclear activities and opened its facilities up to enhanced inspections in return for the partial lifting of international sanctions. However, it was abandoned by US President Donald Trump in 2018, with Israel's approval.Just as the date for a new round of talks was fixed, Iran declared it had produced 25kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity - just below the level that would be needed for a nuclear bomb - and more than 210kg enriched to 20%.While Tehran continues to insist its intentions are peaceful, even Iranian experts have pointed out that such quantities of highly-enriched uranium were previously only held by nuclear armed states."The Iranians today are closer to creating fissile material for nuclear weapons than they ever were in the past," the Israeli security official says. "This fact has significant security implications for the State of Israel."The Israeli defence establishment estimates that if Iran decided to do so, it could now accumulate enough enriched uranium for one nuclear weapon within a month.The manufacture of such a weapon would also require making a warhead that could be mounted on a ballistic missile. The timeframe for that is more difficult to calculate, but some experts say it could take 18 to 24 months.Israel, which is assumed to have its own nuclear weapons but maintains an official policy of deliberate ambiguity, views a nuclear Iran as an existential threat; Iran does not recognise the Israeli state and its officials often espouse a belief that it will eventually cease to exist.While the US and Arab Gulf countries, with which Israel has burgeoning ties, are also deeply opposed to Iran having nuclear weapons, it is not clear to what extent their own interests would hold them back from helping in any military confrontation.Former Israeli National Security Adviser Yaakov Amidror, who is now a senior fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, first warned of the dangers of Iran's nuclear ambitions in the early 1990s, when he worked in military intelligence.He has a bleak assessment of the latest developments."Israel cannot live with a situation in which the Iranians are getting closer and closer to the bomb, and it will soon have to make a decision how to stop it," he says."I don't see any other way but to bomb it, because I don't see the Iranians retreating from their dream of having a nuclear umbrella under which they can be even more aggressive than they are today."Israel has twice acted alone to destroy its enemies' nuclear reactors - in Iraq in 1981, and in 2007 in Syria - with little retaliation.But many analysts question whether it is capable of effectively mounting a complex operation to stop Iran's much more advanced nuclear programme, which involves multiple sites with some underground facilities, and what price it would have to pay."Everyone in Israel understands that [a strike] might lead to a very complicated war," concedes Mr Amidror.Iran has pledged "a shocking response" to any such attack. It is assumed it would use its own forces and co-ordinate with its well-armed proxies spread across the region: Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has tens of thousands of rockets, Shia militias in Syria and Iraq, Yemen's rebel Houthi movement, and Islamic Jihad militants in the Gaza Strip.Despite the grave risks, some hawks in Israel calculate that a strike could be worthwhile, even if it only set back Iranian nuclear plans by a few years.But the official preference is still promoting peaceful, negotiated solutions."I hope that the diplomatic channel will succeed," says Sima Shine, a former head of research for the Mossad intelligence agency, "but I don't give it a high chance right now."US President Joe Biden's administration has proposed to Iran a straightforward return to "mutual compliance" with the JCPOA, but Israel's government opposes that.The deal lifts many restrictions on Iran's nuclear programme as soon as 2025 and did not put limits on Iran's ballistic missile development or curb its support for militant groups across the region."My evaluation of Iran's position is that it actually does not want to go back," says Ms Shine, who now heads the Iran programme at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies."What they would like to see, of course, is a reduction of sanctions and they understand that they have to pay something in order to get it. The question is what is the calculus of Iran - how deeply does its economy need relief?"Her fear is that nuclear talks could just be a way of biding for time, as the country allows its increasingly advanced centrifuges to keep spinning, building up stockpiles of enriched uranium.Another veteran Iran specialist, Alex Vatanka at the Middle East Institute in Washington, emphasises Tehran's deep ideological commitment to its nuclear programme.But despite its mistrust of the Europeans and the US, he believes Iran does want to come back to the JCPOA to ease domestic economic pressures; he sees its recent actions and demands as "strengthening its hand".Mr Vatanka theorises that Iran does not necessarily want nuclear arms."It's an option they would like to have, clearly, but it's not about weaponising," he says, suggesting Iran could stay on the nuclear threshold."It's about Iran being a crucial nuclear state and making the point to the Americans that regime change is not going to happen."Israel's threats of a strike do not convince him. He suggests that its clandestine efforts could be more effective at holding up Iran's nuclear progress."They have proven they can do that," Mr Vatanka comments. "Iran is clearly totally infiltrated at a high level. There's definitely a flow of information that they have."A decade ago, there were reports of a co-ordinated US-Israeli attack involving the use of the Stuxnet computer virus to disrupt the Iranian nuclear programme.More recently, Iran has blamed Israel for the dramatic assassination of its top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who was shot dead near Tehran with an AI-assisted, remote-controlled machine gun, and damaging explosions at its nuclear facilities.As part of what it terms its "war between the wars" Israel has also carried out hundreds of military strikes to reduce Iranian entrenchment in neighbouring Syria and the movement of precision guided munitions to Hezbollah.Although there are many differences among experts about what will happen next, there is a consensus that upcoming talks on Iran's nuclear plans come at a critical time and that the stakes for this volatile region could not be higher.If Iran develops its own nuclear arsenal, other powers - Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt - are likely to follow suit.Washington has said it wants to end "forever wars" in the Middle East. But it has also warned that it will look at "other options" when it comes to Iran, and it too has been seen flexing its military muscle.In a symbolic move, at the end of the recent Israeli air exercise, a US warplane capable of carrying a bunker-busting bomb that could be used to target underground nuclear sites was escorted through through Israeli airspace by two Israeli fighter jets.The paradox - as strategists are keen to drive home - is that serious preparations for military action against Iran could be the best way to stop it from happening.
