The new coronavirus variant Omicron has been detected in 13 people who arrived in the Dutch capital Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa.They are among 61 passengers who tested positive for coronavirus.It comes as tighter restrictions come into force in the Netherlands, amid record Covid cases and concerns over the new variant.This includes early closing times for hospitality and cultural venues, and limits on home gatherings.Omicron was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by South Africa on Wednesday, and early evidence suggests it has a higher re-infection risk. It has been categorised by the WHO as a "variant of concern".The flights by Dutch national carrier KLM from Johannesburg arrived on Friday. Some 600 passengers were held for several hours after arrival while they were tested for the virus.The passengers who have Covid-19 have been quarantined at a hotel near Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.Those that tested negative have been asked to isolate at home for five days and take further tests.  Officials said those in transit would be allowed to continue their journeys, though there were reports on Saturday that some passengers had not received written proof of a negative test and were therefore unable to board onward flights.Following the announcement of the 13 Omicron cases, Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge made an "urgent request" for people returning from southern Africa to get tested for Covid "as soon as possible"."It is not unthinkable that there are more cases in the Netherlands," he told reporters.Cases of the new variant have also been confirmed in several European countries, including the UK, Germany and Italy, as well as Botswana, Israel, Australia and Hong Kong.A number of countries around the world have now banned or restricted flights to and from South Africa and several neighbouring nations in response to the new variant.Meanwhile, the Netherlands is one of several European countries struggling to contain record numbers of infections.It has a shortage of intensive care beds, operations are being cancelled and hundreds of people are dying of Covid every week, the BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague reports.The new restrictions in the country came into force on Sunday morning and will remain in place for at least the next three weeks.The rules set closing times for shops and venues, and limit the number of guests allowed in people's homes.People are also being encouraged to work from home where possible, but nurseries, schools and universities across the country will stay open.Thousands of people protested after the measures were announced.This video can not be played

So accelerating the booster programme both by extending the age range and by reducing the interval between the second dose and the booster dose, would be a sensible strategy."The government has stopped short of issuing advice to work from home and extending vaccine passports in England, which are part of its Plan B for winter - a contingency plan if intervention on Covid is needed to protect the NHS.Mr Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the government "could not have acted more swiftly"."The reason we've set out these measures yesterday is to protect the progress we've made so we can all continue to enjoy Christmas with our families," he said.He said the UK would take further action "in a proportionate way wherever necessary" but he did not think working from home guidance was needed.He did not outline when PCR tests for overseas arrivals would be required, saying it would be "as soon as possible" but he needed agreement from all UK four nations. The government website said the change would be implemented from 04:00 GMT on Tuesday.Mr Javid told Sky News the face mask rules would also be implemented on Tuesday, bringing England in line with the rest of the UK, but he hoped all the new measures could be lifted again "within weeks".The South African doctor who treated early cases of the Omicron variant told the BBC countries could be "panicking unnecessarily" and the symptoms she had seen were "extremely mild".Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, said she had first encountered the variant in patients who had fatigue, aches and pains, but no cough or change in sense of smell or taste. "We haven't admitted anyone," she said.But she acknowledged that understanding of the variant was developing and in two weeks' time they would know more.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said "we may need to go further in restricting travel in the days to come", adding: "We need to be open-minded to doing anything to keep the population safe."At a Downing Street news conference on Saturday, the prime minister called the new measures temporary and precautionary - and said they would be reviewed in three weeks, just before most schools break up for the Christmas holidays.Labour has called for full implementation of Plan B and for improved sick pay to encourage self-isolation.The government's response is to test everyone coming in to the UK, isolate all Omicron contacts, ramp up boosting and bring back compulsory face masks in some public places.Let's be clear - that will not stop more Omicron cases arriving or circulating. It's already arrived. If a virus is good at spreading then eventually it will slip through.And it has the potential to spread here too. Cases of Covid have been climbing except for a lull over the October half term.They are averaging at more than 40,000 a day and the R number is just above the crucial threshold of one. If Omicron can combine faster transmission with some ability to evade immunity then it too could spread.All the measures can do is buy time, but for what? Science and boosters.Read more from JamesBoris Johnson announced the restrictions after it was confirmed that two Omicron cases had been detected in Brentwood, Essex, and Nottingham. Officials said the cases were linked and connected to travel in southern Africa, where the new variant was first identified.Under the plans:In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, face coverings are already mandatory on public transport and many indoor areas.Retail and health workers said the rules on face masks should never have been relaxed, with shopworkers' union Usdaw accusing ministers of "flip-flopping on basic and sensible Covid measures" while the Royal College of Nursing said "it should not have been a new variant that forced the prime minister to act".But Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said "there are major issues about enforcement and it is our members left in the front line with angry passengers who refuse to comply", and called for more resources to support policing the rule.One change has already been implemented. Ten countries - South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia - are now on the UK's travel red list. That was applied from 04:00 GMT, meaning that until further notice any British or Irish residents arriving in the UK after recently visiting any of those countries will have to quarantine in an approved hotel for 10 days.Residents from the countries themselves will not be allowed into the UK until the red list status changes.The average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. A further 39,567 confirmed cases were announced on Saturday.This is a moment the government had wanted to avoid.We've got used to restrictions in England being lifted. But for the first time in months, they're now being re-imposed in response to the new variant.And these restrictions could have a significant impact.For example, anyone who goes on holiday will now need to pay for a PCR test and self-isolate until they get a negative result. If Omicron spreads quickly, there could be a lot of people forced to self-isolate for 10 days as close contacts.But the government hasn't gone for its full plan B. Masks won't be mandatory in hospitality settings in England like they are in Scotland.People aren't being told to work from home - and there still aren't plans for vaccine passports.But it's a sign of the uncertainty and concern in Whitehall that Boris Johnson felt he had to announce these measures.
In the past week a heavily mutated Covid variant has been identified, rapidly labelled a "variant of concern" by the World Health Organization and named Omicron. It has been detected in countries including the UK.It is a rapidly evolving situation. Omicron's genetic profile has raised concerns, but there's a shortage of real-world data that means nobody has the complete picture of what it can do.It is unclear how big a threat it poses.Yet, it is at this early stage, in an absence of definitive facts and when there is a danger of both underreacting and overreacting, that the UK government has to act.It's like you or me deciding whether to marry someone after the first date. Only the stakes are much higher.What we know is Omicron has mutations that theoretically help it to spread more quickly and there is mounting evidence of that happening in South Africa.It also has mutations that theoretically make vaccines less effective and the World Health Organization says there is a higher risk of reinfection than with other variants.But we don't know how transmissible it is. We don't know whether it is milder or more severe. We don't know what will really happen when it comes up against our significant wall of immunity built up through vaccines, boosters and high levels of Covid this autumn.The government's response is to test everyone coming in to the UK, isolate all Omicron contacts, ramp up boosting and bring back compulsory face masks in some public places.Let's be clear - that will not stop more Omicron cases arriving or circulating. It's already arrived. If a virus is good at spreading then eventually it will slip through.And it has the potential to spread here too. Cases of Covid have been climbing except for a lull over the October half term.They are averaging at more than 40,000 a day and the R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to - is just above the crucial threshold of one, which means cases are growing.The government has been focusing on the pressure on hospitals and pre-Omicron this would have been a key factor in whether to tighten restrictions or go for Plan B. But despite the rise in cases, the numbers needing hospital care for Covid has actually been tumbling due to the success of booster vaccines.But if the current Delta variant can spread here and Omicron combines faster transmission with some ability to evade immunity, then it too has the potential to circulate.All the measures can do is buy time, but for what? Science and boosters.There are important scientific questions that need answering and top of the list is what happens when Omicron meets high levels of immunity. The answer, for better or worse, will dictate what happens next.The vaccines that have been used in the UK train the body to attack the spike protein on the virus - specifically the version of spike from the original variant from Wuhan in China.Our immune system learns to attack several parts of that spike. The antibodies in our blood are like a pit crew descending on a Formula 1 car - each going to their target area. But the mutations in Omicron are like changing some parts of the car to bamboozle the mechanics and make their job harder.Any dent to immunity is most likely to affect the odds of you catching Covid. What we've seen from the phenomenon of waning immunity is that protection against severe disease and death is more resilient. It will take time to know for sure.It might sound odd, but booster doses could limit any impact. In theory you can compensate for a less efficient immune defence by simply throwing more antibodies and T-cells at the problem, even if they are imperfect.More than 17 million people have already had a third dose and the government wants to ramp up boosting. Other countries have cut the gap between the second and third dose from six months to five and we should hear from the government's vaccine advisers soon.Pharmaceutical companies say they could update vaccines to match the Omicron variant in around 100 days if they were needed.It is worth noting we do have new weapons in our armoury in the form of anti-viral drugs. Paxlovid and molnupiravir both target the inner workings of the virus and experts have told me there is no suggestion their effectiveness would be knocked by the mutations seen so far.There is also a desire to understand how sick people are getting with Omicron. It is often incorrectly claimed that a virus must become milder as it mutates. The reality is much more complicated and it will take time to get the answer as the country with the most confirmed cases, South Africa, has a relatively young population. The younger you are the milder Covid tends to be.There are already cries that the government is both over-reacting and not going far enough.The problem for all of us is we'll only know the right answer with hindsight.Follow James on Twitter
A 31-year-old woman in Australia has been charged with arson after a fire destroyed part of a Covid-19 quarantine hotel in Cairns, Queensland.It is alleged she lit a fire under a bed in the room she had been sharing with two children on Sunday morning.More than 160 people were evacuated as fire took hold in the 11-storey Pacific Hotel. No-one was injured.It came as Australia confirmed two cases of the new coronavirus variant which is prompting new restrictions.Omicron was first reported by South Africa, and has been classified as "of concern" by the World Health Organization (WHO) with early evidence suggesting a higher re-infection risk.The government in Canberra has announced a suspension of flights from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, the Seychelles, Malawi, and Mozambique. Non-Australians who have been in those countries in the past two weeks are now banned from entering Australia.Australians have spent 20 months under some of the world's strictest border rules, in an effort to keep out Covid.It is not clear whether the new variant will mean a roll-back of some relaxations that began early this month.A surge in vaccinations has allowed some Australian states to end their strategy of eliminating all cases.But unvaccinated travellers are obliged to quarantine for 14 days in hotels in the country.This video can not be played
"Why do you like Shah Rukh Khan?"I put the question about the Bollywood superstar to a couple of my friends recently. They were taken aback - it wasn't a question they had ever considered. I hadn't either, but a new book, Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh, made me wonder.They said he was "charming" and "relatable" as a hero, "funny", "sarcastic" and "candid" in interviews, and "unapologetic" about his pursuit of fame and money. When I pressed, they thought more deeply about the roles he played, remarking on how he was never a "macho" hero, but sensitive and head-over-heels for the women he professed to love."It's true! We love him for his love of women!" one of my friends declared, surprising herself with this realisation.That is exactly what author Shrayana Bhattacharya found when she asked the same question of dozens of women, all fans of Khan.But startlingly, these stories of his female fandom are, in effect, a tale of economic inequity."In telling me about when, how and why they turned to Shah Rukh, they are telling us about when, how and why the world breaks their heart," writes Ms Bhattacharya, unspooling the dreams, anxieties and mutinies that are inexorably linked to the romantic choices women make in a world that forever puts them at a disadvantage.This is no hurried survey. It spans nearly two decades of encounters, conversations and friendships with single, married or somewhere-in-between women in northern India. They are Hindu, Muslim and Christian, happy and unhappy homemakers, content and frustrated working women, and resigned and restless working class women. They are united only by their fandom.Khan swept into our lives in the 1990s, along with Coca-Cola and cable TV, proof of a new era, when a slew of economic reforms threw open India to the world - what we call liberalisation."I wanted to tell a story of those 'post-liberalisation' women and I found in Khan an unusual ally," Ms Bhattacharya says. And how.She was surveying incense stick makers in an urban slum in western India in 2006 when she found that they grew bored with the usual questions about wages. So, during a break, she started chatting to them, asking them about their favourite Bollywood hero."They were much more interested in talking about what delights them and what delighted them was Shah Rukh."It became an ice-breaker in subsequent surveys and soon Ms Bhattacharya found that these women were united not just by Khan but also "an unequal labour market and their own struggles at home". And that didn't change even when she spoke to middle class or wealthy women.Why can't more boys and men be like the Shah Rukh on screen? was a common litany. "They are constructing him - they are all making him up and they are making him up based on their reality and their aspirations," Ms Bhattacharya says.Khan's utter devotion to the heroine signalled a man who would pay real attention, actually listen to a woman. His anxiety about his fate, a defining feature of many of his roles, made him an ideal partner for women, whose lives are rarely in their own hands. His visible vulnerability - Khan was always a messy crier, a rarity for a Bollywood man - meant he didn't shy away from showing his feelings or caring about theirs."I wish someone could talk to me or touch me the way he does with Kajol in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, but that's never going to happen. My husband's moods and hands are so harsh," says a young Muslim garment worker.The rich, unhappily married daughter of erstwhile royals said she wanted to bring up her sons to be "good men". Her definition: they "can cry and they make their wives feel like Shah Rukh makes us feel, safe and loved".These are not merely gushing fangirls, blind to Khan's more problematic roles, which included stalking and violence.Rather, theirs is a critical gaze. They didn't approve of those films and they say so.What stayed with them wasn't the glamour or the drama - although they thoroughly enjoyed that - but the seemingly inconspicuous moments.Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge was one of Khan's biggest hits and possibly Bollywood's most successful and beloved romance - but the mother of a fan girl was struck by something I don't think I ever noticed: "It was the first time I had seen the hero peel a carrot in a film and spend so much time with the women of the household."To her, that was incredibly romantic. It's not that these women didn't speak of lust or sexual attraction, which was expected, but they spoke of so much more.Khan was a distraction from the humdrum or a reprieve from heartbreak and daily injustices. He was the man they wanted to marry not because he was a Bollywood star, but because he was considerate. And a considerate man would let you work, save money, or at least allow your dreams to live - even if all that meant was taking you to the cinema hall to watch the next Shah Rukh-starrer.For so many of his female fans - the bureaucrat whose mother slapped her when, as a teenager, she snuck off to the cinema to watch a Khan film; the young garment worker who had to bribe her brothers with hard-earned money to be able to catch Khan's latest film on the big screen; the domestic help who lied to her priest so she could skip church four Sundays in a row to watch Khan's films on TV - the simple joy of watching a film is a stolen freedom.In fact, many of his poorer fans never watched a movie of his until much later in life, relying instead on songs to feed their fandom. But even that can be frowned upon."It's extremely difficult for women to just have fun - listen to a song or star-gaze at an actor," Ms Bhattacharya says. "When a woman says she likes an actor, she is saying she likes the way a man looks and will probably be judged for it."These women may not be radicals, Ms Bhattacharya writes, but in seeking these indulgences, these simple joys, they rebelled. They rebelled by hiding his posters under their bed, listening and dancing to his songs, and by watching his films - and because of those rebellions, they realised what they truly wanted from life.The bureaucrat, for instance, was determined to make her own way in the world because she never again wanted to ask permission to watch a Khan film. One young woman ran away from home when a secret trip to the cinema for a Khan film led to a hurriedly arranged match with a man who was not a fan and disapproved of the fact that she was. (She has since become a flight attendant and married a man who "evoked the same feelings" as Khan).Khan was not such a delicious promise or forbidden dream for my friends and I, whose privileged world afforded far greater freedom. Until I read this book, I never fully appreciated the quiet rebellion in my mother and aunt's sheer enjoyment of trip to the cinema nearly every Friday for the late-night show. I was taken along, oblivious to my good fortune.But he is nevertheless a common thread that connects our disparate childhoods - one of the women said Khan taught her better English through his interviews. Well, he taught me Hindi.Ms Bhattacharya says he is also an icon of his time - and a lot has changed since he stormed into Bollywood."The younger women don't want to marry Khan, they want to be him - they want his autonomy and his success."Shrayana Bhattacharya's Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh: India's Lonely Young Women and the Search for Intimacy and Independence is published by Harper Collins India
