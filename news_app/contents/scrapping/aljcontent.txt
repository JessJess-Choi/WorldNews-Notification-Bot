Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has signalled a readiness to step up Israel’s confrontation with Iran, reiterating on Tuesday, his country would not be bound by any new Iranian nuclear deal with world powers.Indirect negotiations will begin on November 29 on reviving the 2015 accord, which former United States President Donald Trump withdrew from, deeming it insufficient to shut down projects with bomb-making potential – a view shared by the Israelis.Iran, which denies seeking nuclear arms, has since the US walkout breached the deal with expanded uranium enrichment.Bennett, who took power in June, described Iran in a speech as being at “the most advanced stage of its nuclear programme”.While his government has previously said it would be open to a new nuclear deal with tougher restrictions on Iran, Bennett reasserted Israel’s autonomy to take action against its arch foe.“We face complicated times. It is possible that there will be disputes with the best of our friends,” he told a televised conference hosted by Reichman University.“In any event, even if there is a return to a deal, Israel is of course not a party to the deal and Israel is not obligated by the deal.”Bennett voiced frustration with what he described as Israel’s smaller-scale clashes with Iran’s militia allies.“The Iranians have encircled the State of Israel with missiles while they sit safely in Tehran,” he said.“To chase the terrorist du jour sent by the [Iranian covert] Quds Force does not pay off any more. We must go for the dispatcher.”Stopping short of explicitly threatening war, Bennett said cyber-technologies and what he deemed Israel’s advantages as a democracy and international support could be brought to bear.“Iran is much more vulnerable than is commonly thought,” he said.Israel also sharpened its rhetoric against Iranian combat drones on Tuesday, disclosing what it said were two bases used to carry out maritime attacks with the remote-controlled planes and offering to cooperate with Arab partners on counter-measures.Gulf Arab countries share Israeli concerns about such drones, seeing the hand of Iran or its allies in aerial attacks on shipping or on energy facilities in Saudi Arabia. Tehran has often denied such allegations.“Today I reveal to you two central bases in the area of Chabahar and Qeshm island in south Iran, from which operations in the maritime arena were launched, and where today, too, advanced Shahed attack drones are deployed,” Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz told a televised security conference.Separately, the chief of Israel’s air force proposed working with Arab partners – such as the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, with which Israel formalised ties last year – against the drone threat.“It think that this is a great opportunity to create contacts and to build a defence plan for all the countries that have a common interest in protecting themselves,” Major-General Amikam Norkin told the conference, hosted by Reichman University.“We can help significantly [against drones], whether in terms of intelligence, detection or interception.”
A US destroyer has sailed through the waterway separating Taiwan and China, the United States Navy said, the first such passage since leaders from the two superpowers held a rare video summit earlier this month.The passage through the Taiwan Strait by the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS Milius was a routine transit, the US Seventh Fleet said in a statement.The voyage “demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific”, the statement said.The manoeuvring comes after US President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping traded strong warnings on the future of Taiwan at a virtual summit earlier this month.Chinese state media reported that Xi had cautioned Biden that encouraging Taiwanese independence would be “playing with fire”.In October, Biden appeared to break from a longstanding US policy of strategic ambiguity in regards to Taiwan, saying Washington would come to Taipei’s defence in the event of a Chinese attack.The White House later walked back the statement, saying the US position towards Taiwan remains unchanged.While Washington does not officially recognise Taiwan’s sovereignty, it has for decades provided support, including military training and weapons, to the island, which Beijing considers a renegade region.Washington and Taipei were this week holding their second annual economic dialogue.In October, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen confirmed for the first time in years that US military personnel were present on the island as part of a training mission.US warships periodically conduct exercises in the Taiwan Strait, often triggering angry responses from Beijing, which views the waters as part of its territory. The US and many other countries view the route as international waters open to all.A growing number of US allies have transited the route as Beijing intensifies its military threats towards Taiwan and has sought to solidify its control over the disputed South China Sea.British, Canadian, French and Australian warships have all made passages through the Taiwan Strait in recent years, sparking protests from Beijing.China’s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian slammed the latest transit as a “deliberate attempt to disrupt and undermine regional peace and stability”.“The US should immediately correct its mistake, stop stirring up trouble, crossing the line and playing with fire,” he warned.Collin Koh, a research fellow at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, keeps a database of declared US transits through the Taiwan Strait.Nine were conducted in 2019, followed by 15 in 2020. So far this year there have been 11, including the USS Milius crossing.
Ethiopia’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister says he will lead his country’s army “from the battlefront” starting Tuesday, a dramatic new step as the year-long conflict moves closer to the capital Addis Ababa.Tens of thousands of people are estimated to have been killed as Ethiopian and allied forces fight against forces from the country’s northern Tigray region, who dominated the national government before Abiy Ahmed took office.“Starting tomorrow, I will mobilise to the front to lead the defence forces,” Abiy said in a statement posted on Twitter late on Monday.“Those who want to be among the Ethiopian children who will be hailed by history, rise up for your country today. Let’s meet at the battlefront.”The statement by the 45-year-old prime minister, a former soldier, did not say where exactly he will go Tuesday. His spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, did not respond to a request for comment from the Associated Press news agency.Abiy’s comments came as the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) rebel group continued to press towards Addis Ababa, claiming control of the town of Shewa Robit, just 220km (136 miles) northeast of the capital by road.It also followed a meeting of the ruling Prosperity Party’s executive committee to discuss the war.Defence Minister Abraham Belay told state-affiliated media after the meeting that security forces would embark on a “different action”, without providing details.“There will be change,” Belay said. “What happened and is happening to our people, the abuses being meted out by this destructive, terrorist, robber group, can’t continue.”The United States and others have warned that Africa’s second-most populous country could fracture and destabilise the rest of the region.Former US diplomat William Lawrence noted Abiy had used a lot of war imagery when accepting his Nobel prize but that had been to highlight the horror of war.“And here we are almost full circle with a Nobel Peace Prize winner using the most bellicose language to try and ramp up the stakes ahead of the defence of not only Ethiopia, but life and death,” Lawrence said. “He says he’s basically willing to die for the cause.”Getachew Reda, spokesman for the Tigray forces, tweeted: “Our forces won’t relent on their inexorable advance towards bringing (Abiy’s) chokehold on our people to an end.”The Tigray forces say they are pressuring Ethiopia’s government to lift a months-long blockade of the Tigray region’s six million people, but they also want Abiy out of power.The prime minister, in his statement, said western countries were trying to defeat Ethiopia, echoing his government’s references to “meddling” by the international community.Envoys from the African Union and the US have continued diplomatic efforts in pursuit of a ceasefire and talks without conditions on a political solution.Abbas Haji Gnamo, an expert in Ethiopian politics at the University of Toronto, said many were still hoping for a political solution.“Diplomats have to find a political way,” he told Al Jazeera. “Abiy cannot win this war. The Ethiopian army is relatively weakened. They are losing cities and his going to the battlefront doesn’t change anything, Negotiations are the only way out of this.”Shortly after Abiy’s announcement, a senior US Department of State official told reporters the US still believes “a small window of opportunity exists” in mediation efforts.In the space of a year, Abiy’s government has gone from describing the Tigray conflict as a “law enforcement operation” to an “existential war”. With the Ethiopian military’s retreat from Tigray in June and reports of it being weakened in recent months, ethnic-based regional forces have been intensifying their campaign, and Abiy’s government has called on all able citizens to join the fight.Earlier this month, the government declared a six-month state of emergency.Abiy’s announcement shocked the man who nominated him for the Nobel, Awol Allo, a senior lecturer in law at Keele University in Britain. “The announcement is replete with languages of martyrdom and sacrifice,” he said in a tweet. “This is so extraordinary and unprecedented, shows how desperate the situation is.”Abiy was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for making peace with neighbouring Eritrea, on whose border he fought while stationed in the Tigray region.The terms of that peace deal have never been made public.
The Turkish lira has hit a record low of 12.49 against the US dollar after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan defended recent sharp rate cuts. The Turkish currency crashed by eight percent on Tuesday.The lira has lost 40 percent of its value this year, including a near 20 percent tumble since the beginning of last week. Against the euro, the currency weakened to a fresh record low of 13.4035.Lower rates will help spur economic growth and create jobs, Erdogan said late on Monday in the capital, Ankara.Erdogan has applied pressure on the central bank to pivot to an aggressive easing cycle that aims, he says, to boost exports, investment and jobs – even as inflation soars to near 20 percent and the currency depreciation accelerates, eating deeply into Turks’ earnings.The Turkish president defends an unorthodox theory that higher interest rates cause higher inflation.Most economists, however, contend Turkey faces a huge crisis, including high inflation, in case rates continue to drop in the coming months.Under pressure from Erdogan, the central bank cut key interest rates from 19 to 15 percent in September, driving a free-fall in the lira.Erdogan has replaced three central bank governors in the past two years, undermining investor confidence.
OPEC+ officials warned they’re likely to respond to plans by the world’s largest oil consumers to release oil from their strategic stockpiles, setting up a fight for control of the global energy market.President Joe Biden is set to announce a plan to release reserves from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Tuesday in tandem with China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to officials briefed on the matter. The move, weeks in the planning, is designed to ease this year rise in fuel prices for drivers and businesses.OPEC+ delegates said the release of millions of barrels from the inventories of their biggest customers is unjustified by current market conditions and the group may have to reconsider plans to add more oil production when they meet next week.The tussle threatens the biggest ructions in the geopolitics of oil since the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia in early 2020. At stake is the price of the world’s most important commodity as politicians and central bankers contend with the strongest inflationary surge in more than a decade. It also shows the strained relationship between Washington and Riyadh, traditionally a cornerstone of U.S. relations in the Middle East.The situation remains in flux and the plans could change but the U.S. is considering a release of more than 35 million barrels over time. The pending announcement was described by people who requested anonymity prior to official statements.“Such a move would potentially raise the stakes in the oil poker game and could produce new strains in the bilateral relationship between Washington and Riyadh,” said Helima Croft, chief commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets LLC.Despite the imminent stockpile release prices rallied almost 1% in New York to $76.63 a barrel as traders weighed the prospect on OPEC+ response.The 23-nation alliance already rebuffed calls from U.S. President Joe Biden and others earlier this month to speed up the return of supplies halted during the pandemic. Delegates, declining to be named discussing private deliberations, said that even the modest production increase they have penciled in may now be re-evaluated when the group meets next week.“I anticipate OPEC+ energy ministers will maintain their current plan of adding more supplies to the market gradually,” Joseph McMonigle, Secretary-General of the Riyadh-based International Energy Forum, said in a statement Monday. “However, certain unforeseen external factors such as a release of strategic reserves or new lock-downs in Europe may prompt a reassessment of market conditions,” McMonigle said after a meeting with a Japanese foreign ministry official.For Biden, the coordinated release would mark a diplomatic win for the U.S., especially given the involvement of China. The matter was discussed with President Xi Jinping in a virtual summit last week.His battle to bring down prices stands in contrast to his predecessor Donald Trump’s effort to persuade Saudi Arabia and Russia to end a price war in early 2020 that crashed prices during the start of the coronavirus pandemic.It also shows that in an inflationary environment, where prices of everything from cars to meat are rising, large economies have a lower pain threshold for oil prices. During the Obama administration oil spent years above $100 a barrel without it becoming a political flash point.The move would represent the largest discharge of stockpiled crude from major economies made outside the auspices of the International Energy Agency. Previous global efforts to tap stockpiles — such as the 2011 release of 60 million barrels in the wake of unrest and supply disruptions in Libya — were coordinated by the IEA, of which China isn’t a member.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Saturday his government was considering a release from reserves in coordination with countries such as the U.S. Indian officials said Monday that they were studying a similar move. Indian officials said on Tuesday they were likely to take part.Biden’s decision to marshal support from China, India, and Japan, pulling together the world’s top four consumers, will go down badly in Saudi Arabia, traditionally on American’s closest allies in the Middle East.Since taking office earlier this year, Biden has refused to deal directly with the kingdom’s de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, who he blames for the murder of journalist and activist Jamal Khashoggi.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will meet on Dec. 2 to contemplate an increase of production by 400,000 barrels a day in January.
