Hamas has condemned a move by Britain towards banning the group as a terrorist organisation which could see supporters of the Palestinian movement face up to 14 years in prison.Home Secretary Priti Patel, who will push for the ban in Parliament next week, argued on Friday that it was not possible to distinguish between Hamas’s political and military wings. She called Hamas “fundamentally and rabidly anti-Semitic”, adding the proscription was required to protect the Jewish community.Hamas responded in a statement, saying: “Instead of apologising and correcting its historical sin against the Palestinian people … [Britain] supports the aggressors at the expense of the victims.”That comment referred to the Balfour Declaration and British Mandate, which it said handed “Palestinian lands to the Zionist movement”.“Resisting occupation, by all available means, including armed resistance, is a right guaranteed by international law to people under occupation,” added the statement.The group called on its supporters to condemn the UK’s move, as it described Israel’s occupation of Palestinian lands, forcible displacement of Palestinians, the demolition of their homes, and the siege of more than two million people in Gaza Strip, as “terrorism”.Patel, who is on a trip to Washington, DC, said her move was “based upon a wide range of intelligence, information and also links to terrorism”.“The severity of that speaks for itself,” she said.In 2017, Patel was forced to resign as Britain’s international development secretary after she failed to disclose meetings with senior Israeli officials during a private holiday trip to the country.She met then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-opposition leader Yair Lapid.The Qassam Brigades military wing of the Palestinian movement that rules the Gaza Strip has been banned in Britain since March 2001.An outright ban under the Terrorism Act 2000 will bring the United Kingdom in line with the United States and the European Union.If Patel’s bid is successful, flying Hamas’s flag, arranging to meet its members or wearing clothing supporting the group will be outlawed.Politically, it could force Britain’s main opposition group to take a position on Hamas, given strong pro-Palestinian support among the more left-wing members of the Labour Party.Earlier this month, a man appeared in a British court for wearing T-shirts supporting Hamas’s military wing and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which the UK banned in 2005.On three occasions in June, Feras Al Jayoosi, 34, wore the garments in the Golders Green area of north London, which has a large Jewish population.Hamas is a radical Islamic group that targets innocent Israelis & seeks Israel's destruction.I welcome the UK’s intention to declare Hamas a terrorist organization in its entirety — because that’s exactly what it is.Thank you to my friend @BorisJohnson for your leadership.— Naftali Bennett בנט (@naftalibennett) November 19, 2021Israel’s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett applauded the news, calling Hamas “a radical Islamic group that targets innocent Israelis and seeks Israel’s destruction”.“I welcome the UK’s intention to declare Hamas a terrorist organisation in its entirety – because that’s exactly what it is,” he tweeted.Lapid, now foreign minister, said in a statement: “There is no legitimate part of a terrorist organisation, and any attempt to differentiate … is artificial.”Lapid said the move was a result of “joint efforts” between the British and Israeli governments.Founded in 1987, Hamas is against Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories.Based in Gaza, Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections, defeating its nationalist rival Fatah. It seized military control of Gaza the following year.An 11-day Israeli assault on Gaza in May this year killed at least 250 Palestinians, including 66 children. Israeli officials say, 13 people, including two children, were killed in Israel by Hamas rockets.
Austria will become the first country in Western Europe to reimpose a full coronavirus lockdown to tackle a new wave of infections and will require its whole population to be vaccinated by February, its government has said.Friday’s announcement came as roughly two-thirds of Austria’s population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, one of the lowest rates in western Europe.The country’s infection rate is among the highest on the continent, with a seven-day incidence of 991 per 100,000 people.Austria had introduced a lockdown for all those who were unvaccinated on Monday but since then, infections have set new records.The two worst-hit provinces, Salzburg and Upper Austria, said on Thursday they would introduce their own lockdowns, raising pressure on the government to do the same nationally.“We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,” Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference, saying the lockdown would start on Monday.He blamed those refusing to be vaccinated for an “attack on the health system” and said, “it hurts that such measures still have to be taken.”Public scepticism about vaccines has been encouraged by Austria’s far-right Freedom Party, the third-biggest in parliament, which is planning an anti-lockdown protest on Saturday.The new measures mean people are no longer allowed to leave their houses with few exceptions such as shopping for essentials and exercising.Al Jazeera’s Dominic Kane, reporting from neighbouring Germany’s capital, Berlin, said Austrians had in recent weeks faced a “sliding scale” of gradually imposed restrictions.“Now they are into full lockdown and clearly the reason for this is because the incidence of COVID-19 in many parts of Austria is now in four digits – more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 people,” he said.“That is a very considerable number and for many politicians in Austria right now, it is too much.”The issue of whether to impose additional COVID-19 measures in Austria deepened a rift between Schallenberg’s conservatives and their coalition partner, the left-wing Greens.Schallenberg said only days ago that he did not want to enforce extra restrictions on the unvaccinated, even as Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein called for a nighttime curfew.But the chancellor said on Friday that those who refused to be vaccinated would now face fines, adding the details would be finalised in the coming weeks.“For a long time, the consensus in this country was that we didn’t want mandatory vaccination,” Schallenberg said. “For a long time, perhaps too long.”With cold weather setting in, many European governments have been forced to consider bringing back measures to curtail the virus, including unpopular lockdowns.A fourth wave has plunged Germany, Europe’s largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Friday.He urged people to reduce their social contacts, warning that vaccinations alone would not lower case numbers.Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn said, “We are now in a situation – even if this produces a news alert – where we can’t rule anything out.“We are in a national emergency,” he told a news conference.Hungary, which also neighbours Austria, is making wearing masks indoors again compulsory from Saturday, the government said on Thursday.Meanwhile, the Netherlands has reimposed a partial lockdown, with bars and restaurants closing at 8pm (19:00 GMT).
Hundreds of migrants and refugees attempted to cross from Belarus into Poland overnight as the situation at the border remains tense, despite a diplomatic push to resolve the crisis.Polish Border Guard spokeswoman Anna Michalska said on Friday that a group of 500 people had tried to enter the European Union member state on Thursday evening, aided by Belarusian authorities who had earlier cleared the main camps at the border.“[The Belarusians] were bringing more migrants to the place where there was a forced attempt to cross,” Michalska said.“At the start, there were 100 people, but then the Belarusian side brought more people in trucks. Then there were 500 people.”Michalska told the AFP news agency that Poland detained 45 people, claiming that members of the group had thrown rocks and hurled tear gas shells at Polish officials while Belarusian security forces used lasers to blind them.Al Jazeera, like all other media, is unable to independently verify claims about activity on the border as Poland has banned reporters from accessing the 3km (2 miles)-wide zone.The latest crossings and detentions came after Belarus moved people along the border to a nearby reception centre and followed the first Iraqi repatriation flight which returned hundreds to Erbil and Baghdad. These developments had appeared to signal a change of tack by Minsk that could help calm a crisis that has spiralled in recent weeks into a serious East-West confrontation.Poland and its allies accuse Belarus of deliberately enticing thousands of migrants and refugees, many of whom are from the Middle East, and funnelling them to the country’s frontier with Poland in response to Western sanctions against President Alexander Lukashenko’s government.Minsk, backed by Russia, denies that and has accused Polish security forces of carrying out crimes against humanity while repelling people trying to enter the EU.Aid groups say at least 11 asylum seekers and refugees have died on both sides of the border since the crisis began earlier this year – although the real number is believed to be higher – as concerns grow for people’s wellbeing as freezing winter conditions set in.But in recent days, a flurry of diplomatic activity seemingly aimed to improve the situation.This week, Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke by telephone twice to Lukashenko, normally shunned by European leaders.On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Lukashenko held another phone call about the crisis and stressed the importance of cooperation between Minsk and the EU,  the Kremlin said.Those efforts are yet to achieve a resolution, however.On Thursday, the European Commission and Germany rejected a proposal by Minsk, under which the EU would take in 2,000 migrants and refugees now in Belarus, and 5,000 others would be sent back to their home countries.Al Jazeera’s Assed Baig, reporting from the Polish border town Hajnowka, said those still stranded in Belarus, many of whom appear reluctant to turn back, were “just pawns … in a much larger political game taking place”.Since the beginning of the year, Poland’s border guard service says it has recorded more than 34,000 attempted crossings from Belarus, including more than 6,000 so far in November, nearly 17,300 in October, close to 7,700 in September and more than 3,500 in August, when the crisis started.While there has been a decline over the last month, Michalska told AFP the “latest attempts have become more aggressive”.
Since the early summer, the mobile phones of Armenian and Azerbaijani military combatants have provided partial but dramatic accounts of a new and evolving confrontation between the two countries.Back in May, soldiers filmed themselves overrunning enemy outposts shouting in broken Russian at their opponents to leave, orchestrated with kicks to backsides, punches or volleys from assault rifles fired into the air.In picturesque alpine meadows, platoons of Armenian and Azeri troops faced off, often just a few metres apart. It was a tinderbox that burst into flames on the afternoon of November 16.While there is no independently verifiable information, military sources and local media reported a full-scale battle for several hours along a stretch of border between Azerbaijan and Armenia on or near Mount Ishkhanasar.Both sides have reported casualties; Armenia said at least six soldiers were killed, while Azerbaijan announced the deaths of at least seven troops.Mobile footage shows an Azerbaijani artillery unit bombarding Armenian positions. Armenia’s Ministry of Defence released a video of Azerbaijani armoured vehicles being struck by guided weapons.Harrowing video shot at night in a blizzard appears to show Azerbaijani soldiers beating uniformed Armenian regulars on the ground.This is Armenia and Azerbaijan’s new conflict: for control of disputed borders defined by Soviet cartographers.Until the last year’s war over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, those borders were buffered by territories inside Azerbaijan under de facto Armenian control since the 1990s.But with Azerbaijan’s military victory and the recapturing of almost all of its lost territories, the border areas between Armenia’s Syunik and Gegharkunik provinces, and Azerbaijan’s newly established East Zangezur region have become militarised front lines.Olesya Vartanyan, a senior analyst with the Brussels-headquartered International Crisis Group, said that in the mountainous terrain, both armies are keen to establish positions on the best available ground.“The current daily problem is that troops of opposite sides do not have communication with each other. The same is between Azerbaijani and Armenian Joint Staffs. When one side observes several big trucks with soldiers, he right away suspects possible preparations for an assault. There is no way to check before starting an attack.”Syunik Province separates Azerbaijan from its exclave, the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, in some places by less than 40km (25 miles).Crucially, roads that connect Armenian towns and villages in Syunik run through Azerbaijani territory, and here Azerbaijani forces have established checkpoints.Armenia’s Human Rights Defender Arman Tatoyan has accused Azerbaijan of a deliberate policy of isolation, describing the nearly impassible alternative routes villagers have been forced to take. School children and teachers have been unable to get to school.“The blockade of the Goris-Kapan road or the so-called Azerbaijani border and customs checkpoints will cause violations of the rights of the civilian population and severe humanitarian issues, including the isolation of a number of civilian communities,” Tatoyan told Armenian media.While Azerbaijan maintains that Armenia provoked the latest fighting, geolocation of some of the footage recorded since Tuesday strongly indicates incursions by Azerbaijani armed forces inside Armenia proper.Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan claimed on Tuesday that since May, 41 square kilometres (15 square miles) of sovereign Armenian territory have been seized by Azerbaijan in the border areas.Azerbaijan may have a strategy: to pressure Armenia to conclude negotiations following last year’s ceasefire agreement over Nagorno-Karabakh.Those terms included a commitment by Armenia to allow “unobstructed access” between the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and Azerbaijan.Fuad Shahbaz, a military analyst from Baku, says the latest fighting is a result of those negotiations failing to achieve their objectives, including the demarcation of the borders.“Yerevan is not ready for concessions on a transit route and I guess Baku lost patience. It was hoping to resolve the issue before the winter during a planned November meeting in Moscow which was postponed.”While Shahbaz believes the opening of a route to Nakhchivan would benefit both Azerbaijan and Armenia by linking up with Turkey, for many Armenians it poses a direct threat to Armenian statehood.“The Azerbaijan strategic goal is to establish at least de facto control over Syunik province,” says Benyamin Poghosyan, a Yerevan-based political scientist. “President Aliyev of Azerbaijan has stated many times publicly that Syunik province artificially separates the Turkic world spanning from Istanbul to Kazakhstan.”Russia’s military presence in Armenia is supposed to guarantee Armenian security, and Russian boots on the ground in Karabakh are helping to maintain a fragile peace, albeit with occasional outbreaks of localised violence.So far, Armenia has not officially requested Russian military intervention as part of its Collective Security Treaty with Moscow. But Moscow can exert influence in a way that no other mediator can.“It is the only regional power with an actual military presence on the ground and a serious political say with leaders in both capitals. So it’s no surprise that Moscow is succeeding. Especially where the OSCE Minsk Group has been struggling to renew its functions,” said Vartanyan.The so-called Minsk Group is co-chaired by Russia, France and the United States and was established in 1994 after the first Karabakh war to work for a permanent peace between Armenian and Azerbaijan.“Only recently the co-chairs found a way to propose an agenda and a format that can satisfy both sides. But they still have a long way to go before conversations that can lead to real change.”An intervention by Russia’s Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu led to a cessation in the fighting on November 16.For the time being, the guns are silent.
The founder of a Philippines church trafficked girls and young women and forced them to have sex with him on pain of eternal damnation, the US Justice Department has charged.Cash raised for a bogus California-based charity was used to recruit victims who would be brought to the United States from the Philippines to work in a church called the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, The Name Above Every Name (KOJC), the department said on Friday as it indicted the founder.Some would be put to work raising more cash to help fund a lavish lifestyle for Apollo Carreon Quiboloy, an ally of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte.The 71-year-old, referred to by church members as “The Appointed Son of God”, along with two co-defendants is now charged with sex-trafficking of females aged 12 to 25 years to work as personal assistants, or “pastorals,” for Quiboloy, a wide-ranging indictment says.“The victims prepared Quiboloy’s meals, cleaned his residences, gave him massages and were required to have sex with Quiboloy in what the pastorals called ‘night duty’,” the department said in a press release.“Defendant Quiboloy and other KOJC administrators coerced pastorals into performing ‘night duty’ – that is, sex – with defendant Quiboloy under the threat of physical and verbal abuse and eternal damnation.”The indictment alleges the sex trafficking scheme ran for at least 16 years until 2018.Victims who complied were rewarded with “good food, luxurious hotel rooms, trips to tourist spots, and yearly cash payments that were based on performance,” paid for with money solicited by KOJC workers in the United States, according to the indictment.The indictment builds on a previous indictment to include a total of nine defendants. Three were arrested in the US on Thursday.Quiboloy, who maintained large residences in Hawaii, Las Vegas, and a swanky suburb of Los Angeles, is thought to be in Davao City, in the Philippines, along with two others named in the charge, the Justice Department said.The church claims to have accumulated six million members in 200 countries since it was founded by Quiboloy in 1985, according to its website.Duterte appears in photos posted on Quiboloy’s official Facebook page in October, captioned: “President Rodrigo Duterte in a private dinner with close friend and spiritual adviser Pastor Apollo C. Quiboloy.”Presidential spokesman Karlo Nograles declined to comment on Duterte’s “personal relationship” with Quiboloy.Nograles said he was not aware if the United States had filed an extradition request for Quiboloy, but the Philippines would “cooperate if there is one against whoever.”A secretary for Quiboloy’s lawyer in the Philippines told the AFP news agency there was “an emergency meeting” and her boss, Dinah Tolentino-Fuentes, was not available to comment on the case.
