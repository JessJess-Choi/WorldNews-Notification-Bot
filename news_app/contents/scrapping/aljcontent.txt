India’s health ministry says the severity of the COVID-19 disease from the Omicron variant in the country could be low because of the country’s vaccination programme and widespread exposure to the Delta variant.“Given the fast pace of vaccination in India and high exposure to Delta variant as evidenced by high seropositivity, the severity of the disease is anticipated to be low,” it said in a statement on Friday.“However, scientific evidence is still evolving.”India on Friday reported 9,216 new COVID-19 infections after announcing its first two Omicron cases the previous day. Deaths rose by 391, bringing the total to 470,115.Total COVID-19 cases have now reached 34.62 million, health ministry data showed.The health ministry on Thursday confirmed its first cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant in two people and officials said one passenger had arrived from South Africa and the other, a person who had not travelled to the country at all.The ministry said the cases involved two men in the southern Karnataka state, a 66-year-old man who had travelled to India from South Africa and a 46-year-old doctor.Hundreds of contacts of the two men have been traced and tested for the virus and at least five people have tested positive for the virus.Health officials said the 66-year-old man who tested positive was asked to self-isolate in the hotel where he was staying because he had no symptoms.The man tested himself again privately on November 23 and after receiving a negative result travelled to Dubai on November 27, state health officials said.The 46-year-old doctor was tested on November 22 after he had a fever and his body ached, officials said. He self-isolated the same day and five of his contacts tested positive afterwards and have since been isolated.Much remains unknown about the new variant, including whether it is more contagious, as some health authorities suspect, whether it makes people more seriously ill and whether it can thwart the vaccine.India has already classified several countries as “at-risk” in response to the Omicron variant, and travellers from those countries are being tested after they arrive in India.In addition, India is testing 2 percent of all other international travellers randomly. Genome sequencing is also being done to detect the variant. Nearly 8,000 passengers have been tested since Wednesday.Dr Balram Bhargava, head of the Indian Council of Medical Research, India’s top medical research organisation, urged people not to panic and get vaccinated.“Increased vaccine uptake is the need of the hour. Don’t delay in getting fully vaccinated,” he said.Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, a health policy expert, said the focus should be on finding the unvaccinated and making sure they receive shots.“Some of the hesitancy may disappear on the news of the new variant. But this can’t be taken for granted,” he said.Some Indian states have issued strict restrictions on international arrivals as precautionary measures, including mandatory COVID-19 tests for those coming from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong.More than 56 percent of Indians have received at least one vaccine dose – 32 percent are fully vaccinated and 24 percent have received a single shot, according to Our World In Data.
London, United Kingdom – On an overcast day in Newham, a London borough, it looks like business as usual on Green Street as customers buy groceries, jewellery and new South Asian outfits.But a sense of stoicism is sometimes interrupted by fear as people worry about what another coronavirus wave could mean.By January this year, COVID-19 mortality rates were about three times higher in Newham – 441 deaths per 100,000 people – the worst-hit London borough, compared with 150 deaths in Camden, the least affected area of the capital.Everyone’s face here is now covered in line with recent government guidance that made mask-wearing in shops and public transport mandatory once again, as COVID resurges.On Wednesday night, the borough, one of London’s poorest, suffered a large dose of bad news.A local health official announced on Twitter that a case of COVID with the new Omicron variant had been detected, and encouraged people to get their vaccines and take regular COVID tests.During the height of the second wave, Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, and Newham, three neighbouring boroughs in east London, saw the country’s highest infection rates.They were dubbed the “COVID triangle”.At the time, Barking and Dagenham reported that one in 16 people was said to be infected with the virus.Between March and April 2020, the first wave of the pandemic, Newham, a historically multicultural hub made up of Asians, Africans, and Afro-Caribbeans, recorded the highest age-standardised rate with 144.3 deaths per 100,000.COVID has had a severe effect, but people are now trying to adapt.Many residents do front-line jobs – in health services, public transport, as cleaners or caregivers – and cannot work from home. There is a housing crisis in the area and overcrowding affects 25.2 percent of households.Vaccine uptake was worryingly slow, but has since picked up.The mayor of Newham, Rokhsana Fiaz, told Al Jazeera: “We can’t underestimate the devastating impact that the new Omicron COVID-19 variant could have, and so we all need to play our part.“We are asking our residents and businesses to do three things. Firstly, get tested. Regular testing is easy, quick and appropriate for everyone in our borough. Secondly, get vaccinated and, where appropriate, have a booster. We can be confident that the vaccine is our best and safest defence against the pandemic.“Thirdly, wear face coverings when in public places.”As the winter cold sweeps through Green Street, shop windows are adorned with signs in various languages urging people: “Please wear a mask covering.”Singh, who owns Colours, a clothes shop on Green Street, told Al Jazeera: “I’m not as worried about the variant as last year, because everyone is vaccinated.“The pandemic was a dramatic change in our life. Everything has completely changed, from business to relationships with the landlord, because you make a statement, you make a commitment, and the next month is a lockdown.“What I want is no more lockdowns. We should live with this.”Singh said he and his team members are all vaccinated. He has booked a booster shot for this week.Shaila, who worked in a shop further down the street, said she is not hugely worried about the new variant because “we’re used to it [Covid] now, we just have to be careful”.One sexual health professional Al Jazeera interviewed in Newham, who requested anonymity, said that in the first wave, patients opened up about unrelated concerns because other social services were under pressure.“In these conversations we were having with people, they’re disclosing issues around domestic violence, mental health, suicidal ideation, just really high levels of vulnerability,” they said.It was “really stressful, really uncomfortable and really unsettling because you’re experiencing the first-hand anxiety of this virus in your local community,” they said, adding that the experience was one reason why they left the profession.While the wider area was set up to be a regeneration project after hosting the 2012 Olympics, much of Newham is yet to benefit.When the pandemic started at the beginning of 2020, a Shelter report found that in the borough, one in 24 people was homeless – one of the country’s highest rates.Mariam Dawood, a Labour councillor in Newham, told Al Jazeera that while the government has acknowledged that COVID has disproportionately affected the borough, the context of austerity measures in working-class communities should not be forgotten.“Since 2010, the government has slashed Newham Council’s budget by 50 percent,” she said. “Despite pledges to help those on low incomes … the government has not taken adequate measures to tackle social inequality, and austerity cuts continue. This has made it more challenging to combat COVID.”Even so, Dawood remains hopeful.“The pandemic has shown that when there is a crisis, people do come together to support one another, especially in Newham.“We saw this in the emergence of mutual aid groups and community-led food banks.”In light of the discovery of the new variant, Dawood said more people have been wearing masks.“There has also been an uptake in local people getting their first vaccine, which suggests that those who may have felt uneasy about taking the vaccine previously are worried about the emergence of new strains.”
The son of Libya’s longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi has been given the go-ahead to run in the country’s upcoming presidential election, his lawyer said, a week after being disqualified for what Libyan authorities said were war crimes committed during the uprising against his father more than 10 years ago.Saif al-Islam Gaddafi’s lawyer, Khaled al-Zaydi, confirmed to Al Jazeera on Thursday that the court in Sebha accepted his client’s appeal, lodged earlier in the day, and that he would therefore be reinstated in the presidential election scheduled to take part later this month.In disqualifying Gaddafi, Libya’s electoral commission had pointed to articles of the electoral law stipulating that candidates “must not have been sentenced for a dishonourable crime” and must present a clean criminal record.Western officials have talked up a United Nations-led peace process and insist on “inclusive” and “credible” elections starting on December 24 in the North African country, despite serious disputes over how they should be held, and their credibility.Libya is seeking to move beyond a decade of violence that has rocked the oil-rich nation since a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed Gaddafi senior in 2011.Gaddafi, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, had registered to run on November 14 but was among 25 candidates whose bids have were rejected by the elections board last week.It said the 25 had been rejected on legal grounds as well as information from officials including the public prosecutor, a police chief and the head of the passports and citizenship department.Gaddafi had lodged an appeal in Sebha, but last week a “group of outlaws” launched an “odious” attack on the court, forcing it to shut hours before the appeal hearing, the government in Tripoli said.He was the first heavyweight candidate to sign up for the election, after emerging from years in the shadows and telling The New York Times in July that he was planning a political comeback.In the rare interview, Gaddafi said he wanted to “restore the lost unity” of Libya after a decade of chaos.A rival administration in eastern Libya later pardoned him.Analysts fear a contested vote, or one with clear violations, could derail a peace process that this year led to the formation of a unity government in an effort to bridge the rift between warring eastern and western factions.A final list of candidates for the election has not yet been released amid a chaotic appeals process.Gaddafi, who was sentenced to death by a Tripoli court in absentia in 2015 for war crimes committed during the failed battle to save his father’s 40-year rule from a NATO-backed uprising, is one of several divisive candidates in the race.He is a figurehead for Libyans still loyal to the former government of his father, whose toppling and death in 2011 heralded a decade of strife. After his lawyer announced the decision, his supporters celebrated in the streets across Sebha, witnesses said.However, many other Libyans, including in the armed groups that hold the balance of power across swaths of the country, view his presence on the ballot as unacceptable after the bloody struggle to remove his father.Another divisive candidate who has joined the poll fray is eastern-based renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar, whose Libyan National Army (LNA) controls much of eastern and southern Libya. Haftar, a former CIA asset, has also been accused of war crimes.Anas El Gomati, a Libyan researcher and founder of the Sadeq Institute, told Al Jazeera that Gaddafi’s reinstatement in the presidential race would erode people’s trust in the electoral process.“When we look at the process over the last several days, we’ve seen candidates that have been declared ineligible … then reinstated without any legal argument,” El Gomati told Al Jazeera.“I think it is going to puzzle many Libyans today who have protested the candidacy of individuals like Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and Khalifa Haftar but who are now on the ballot box.”“It’s a major plot twist but it’s not the last one. I think there’s still a few more to come.”
The head of a United Nations team investigating ISIL’s (ISIS) atrocities in Iraq has said the armed group’s fighters committed crimes against humanity and war crimes at a prison in the northern city of Mosul, where at least 1,000 mostly Shia Muslim prisoners were systematically killed seven years ago.Christian Ritscher told the UN Security Council on Thursday that evidence collected from mass graves containing the remains of victims of executions carried out at Badush Central Prison and from survivors shows detailed preparations of the attack by senior ISIL members followed by an assault on the morning of June 10, 2014.“Prisoners captured were led to sites close to the prison, separated based on their religion and humiliated,” he said. “At least 1,000 predominantly Shia prisoners were then systematically killed.”Ritscher said the investigators’ analysis of digital, documentary, survivors and forensic evidence, including ISIL documents, has identified a number of members from the group who were responsible for the crimes.SA Ritscher @#UNSC: I can announce that in Badush Prison attacks, #ISIL members committed #WarCrimes & #CrimesAgainstHumanity including, murder, extermination, torture, enforced disappearances, persecution, willful killing, torture, inhumane treatment, & other inhumane acts. pic.twitter.com/4sMIuL1lDe— UNITAD (@UNITAD_Iraq) December 2, 2021As a result of the investigations, he said the UN Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by the Islamic State in Iraq (UNITAD) has concluded that ISIL committed “crimes against humanity of murder, extermination, torture, enforced disappearances, persecution and other inhumane acts” at Badush prison as well as the “war crimes of willful killing, torture, inhumane treatment, and outrage upon personal dignity”.ISIL fighters seized Iraqi cities and declared a self-styled caliphate in a large swath of territory in Syria and Iraq in 2014. The group was formally declared defeated in Iraq in 2017 following a three-year bloody battle that left tens of thousands dead and cities in ruins, but its sleeper cells continue to launch attacks in different parts of Iraq. On Friday, at least three civilians and seven Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters were killed in an attack blamed on ISIL.In May, Ritscher’s predecessor, Karim Khan, told the Security Council that investigators had found “clear and compelling evidence” that ISIL fighters committed genocide against the Yazidi minority in 2014. He also said the armed group successfully developed chemical weapons and used mustard gas.Ritscher hailed the “landmark moment” earlier this week that saw the first-ever conviction of an ISIL member for the crime of genocide at the regional court in Frankfurt, Germany. Taha al-Jumailly, a 29-year-old Iraqi, was also convicted of crimes against humanity, war crimes and bodily harm resulting in death over the death of a five-year-old Yazidi girl he had bought as a slave with her mother and then chained up in the hot sun to die.“We now have the chance, collectively, to make such prosecutions the norm, not a celebrated exception,” Ritscher said. “In cooperation with Iraqi authorities and those of the Kurdistan region, together with survivors and with the support of this council, we are building the evidence that can deliver meaningful justice for all those who suffered from ISIL crimes in Iraq.”Ritscher also said evidence collected relating to the Badush prison attacks underlined the detailed planning by ISIL in carrying out their atrocities.The group’s approach “is seen even more clearly in two other key lines of investigation that have accelerated in the last six months: the development and use of chemical and biological weapons by ISIL, and the financial mechanisms through which it sustained its campaign of violence,” he said.The team’s evidence also “shows that ISIL clearly identified and then seized chemical production factories and other sources of precursor material, while also overtaking the University of Mosul campus as a hub for research and development,” Ritscher said.The group’s programme became more sophisticated and investigators have identified more than 3,000 victims of ISIL chemical weapons attacks as well as its use of rocket artillery projectiles containing a mustard sulphur agent, he said.In his next briefing to the Security Council, Ritscher said he will present the team’s findings on ISIL’s use of chemical weapons including the crimes it committed.He also stressed the critical importance of bringing ISIL’s financiers and those who profit from the group’s crimes to justice.Ritscher said investigators have uncovered the inner workings of the ISIL central treasury and a network of senior leaders who also acted “as trusted financiers, diverting wealth that ISIL gained through pillage, theft of property from targeted communities and the imposition of a systematic and exploitative taxation system imposed on those living under ISIL control”.He said the team recently shared information with the Iraqi judiciary on the use of money service businesses by the group “as key facilitators of their financing,” and it looks forward to expanding this kind of cooperation.
