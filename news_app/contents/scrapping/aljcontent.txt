A Sri Lankan factory manager in Pakistan has been beaten to death and set ablaze by a mob, police confirmed, in an incident local media reported was linked to alleged blasphemy.The incident took place in Sialkot, about 200km (125 miles) southeast of the capital Islamabad, on Friday.Few issues are as galvanising in Pakistan as blasphemy, and even the slightest suggestion of an insult to Islam can supercharge protests and incite lynchings.Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was overseeing the investigation into “the horrific vigilante attack”, as he called it “a day of shame for Pakistan”.“Let there be no mistake all those responsible will be punished with full severity of the law,” he tweeted.The horrific vigilante attack on factory in Sialkot & the burning alive of Sri Lankan manager is a day of shame for Pakistan. I am overseeing the investigations & let there be no mistake all those responsible will be punished with full severity of the law. Arrests are in progress— Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) December 3, 2021A police official in Sialkot, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, said investigators believed the attackers had accused the manager of blasphemy for tearing down a poster with Islamic holy verses.Several gruesome video clips shared on social media showed a mob beating the prone victim while chanting slogans against blasphemy.Other clips showed his body set ablaze, as well as the overturned wreckage of what was said to be his car.Many in the mob made no attempt to hide their identity and some took selfies in front of the burning corpse.Punjab government spokesman Hassaan Khawar told reporters in Lahore that police have already arrested 50 people.“CCTV footage is being carefully looked into as we have been directed to complete the inquiry within 48 hours,” he said.The slogans chanted in the social media videos were the same used by supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) – an anti-blasphemy party.The TLP has in the past paralysed the country with protests, including an anti-France campaign after Paris-based satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo last year republished cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.Mob killings over accusations of blasphemy have been frequent in Pakistan, where the crime can carry the death sentence.Tahir Ashrafi, Khan’s adviser for interfaith harmony, condemned the killers in a recorded video statement shared on social media.“It is a barbaric act and against Islam’s teaching,” he said.A senior Pakistan official told AFP news agency that Islamabad had been in touch with Sri Lankan diplomats over the incident “and have assured them that all those involved in the heinous crime will be brought to justice”.Rights groups say accusations of blasphemy can often be wielded to settle personal vendettas, with minorities largely the target.“Today’s event underscores the urgency with which an environment that enables abuse and puts lives at risk must be rectified,” Amnesty International South Asia said in a tweet under the hashtag #Sialkot, which was trending in Pakistan.
Kyiv, Ukraine – As early as January, the Kremlin may unleash a “brief and victorious” war on Ukraine, a top military expert has told Al Jazeera, as world leaders and international bodies weigh the possibility of such a conflict.Russian President Vladimir Putin wants his troops to reach the Dnieper River that dissects Ukraine, seize a land corridor to annexed Crimea and ensure the resumption of water supply to the arid peninsula that was cut off in 2014 causing a chronic drought, said Ihor Romanenko, a retired lieutenant general and Ukraine’s former deputy chief of staff.The blitzkrieg will not just involve tens of thousands of Russian servicemen currently deployed to the border with Ukraine, which is east of the capital Kyiv, and to Crimea, which is south of mainland Ukraine, he said.It may include an invasion of Russian troops from Moscow-friendly Belarus, which is north of Kyiv, and Transdnistria, a breakaway, pro-Moscow Moldovan region stretches across Ukraine’s southwestern border, he said.“The most effective way is to begin military action from all sides simultaneously,” Romanenko told Al Jazeera.Ukrainian officials say that Russia amassed up to 115,000 troops near its borders in recent weeks.According to Romanenko, there could also be domestic “provocations” that involve disgruntled oligarchs, pro-Kremlin politicians and a sizeable number of Russian-speaking Ukrainians in Ukraine’s east and south – while Moscow stops the supply of natural gas that heats almost every Ukrainian house and apartment building.Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that his nation’s richest oligarch Rinat Akhmetov was “being dragged” into an alleged coup to overthrow the government.Akhmetov denied the allegations.If a serious conflict breaks out, a third of Ukraine, a France-sized nation of 43 million, would be affected – and war would have to be quick, no longer than a month, to avoid public dissatisfaction in Russia, Romanenko said.And even though many Western nations pledged to help Ukraine with weaponry, Ukrainians “understand that no one will fight for us,” Romanenko concluded.Some in the West agree.United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Moscow about “severe costs and consequences” after meeting his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Sweden on Thursday.He said US President Joe Biden may meet with Putin in the nearest future “to speak directly.”The first and so far, only Biden – Putin summit took place in June, less than two months after Russia scaled back a previous build-up of more than 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border.But a few months later, Western and Ukrainian fears of Russian “aggression” resurged.In late November, US intelligence warned their European Union counterparts about the possibility of Russia’s “rapid, large-scale push” into Ukraine from multiple locations, Bloomberg reported.The Kremlin dismissed the claims.“This hysteria is created artificially,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told reporters on November 21. “This is not very logical and not very decent.”Pro-Kremlin observers claim that the “hysteria” helps the Ukrainian president overcome his plummeting approval ratings and stifle critics.“By pumping fear, Zelenskyy’s team is trying to get additional resources to fight opposition, dissidents,” Dmitry Perlin told Radio Sputnik on Thursday, adding that Ukraine “must think twice, even thrice, before making military decisions” to counter Russia.Other experts disagree with the invasion scenario and say Putin is simply bluffing to force the West – especially the US – to be more attentive to his demands.“We’re not talking about an invasion but about a generation of uncertainty, of geopolitical entropy to achieve a critical mass to coerce the West to start the new Yalta talks with Russia,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera.He was referring to the 1945 conference in the southern Crimean city between the Soviet leader Josef Stalin, UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D Roosevelt.The conference carved up the post-World War II world turning Eastern European nations into Soviet vassals.These days, Moscow sees its ties to Ukraine as part of its broader, spiralling confrontation with the West – and NATO’s eastwards expansion to Russia’s former back yard.“Russia talks about red lines, but implies Western guarantees of non-deployment of troops and arms in Ukraine, which is equal to admitting that Ukraine is the area of special, if not exclusive, interests of Russia,” Pavel Luzin, a Russia-based defence analyst with the Jamestown Foundation, a think-tank in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera.Putin claims the West ignores Russia’s “red lines” by holding drills in the Black Sea and dispatching sophisticated arms to Kyiv.He has demanded “legal guarantees” that NATO would not accept Ukraine as a member.“We will never allow our historical territories and people close to us living there to be used against Russia,” Putin wrote in an article in July, reiterating his claim that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people.”If an invasion took place, the West would inevitably slap sanctions on Russia – and both moves would harm Russia’s economy.It would be “suicidal” for Russia to start the invasion because the US and the EU will stop buying Russia’s hydrocarbons and fertiliser and will give up on Nord Stream 2, a brand new natural gas pipeline to Germany that awaits certification, Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University said.Russia will lose two-thirds of its foreign trade revenues, while US energy companies will reanimate their shale oil and liquefied natural gas projects to compensate for the lost exports from Russia, he said.“The very existence of Putin’s regime that stands on oil exports will be in question,” Mitrokhin told Al Jazeera.Another important factor is the revival of Ukraine’s military might.In 2014, Ukrainian troops were under-equipped and demoralised, when pro-Russian separatists in the southeastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk took up arms against Kyiv carving out two totalitarian, economically stillborn “People’s Republics”.But seven years later, as the trench war against the separatists smouldered, Ukraine’s military is battle-trained – and equipped with better weaponry, produced domestically or supplied by the West or Turkey.“Putin is artificially spiralling the degree of hysteria because Moscow realised that the Ukrainian military is irreversibly re-arming with all the US, Turkish and, soon, German supplies, and won’t be so critically weak in the face of the Russian invasion with conventional weapons,” Mitrokhin said.
The Taliban has issued a decree barring forced marriage in Afghanistan, saying women should not be considered “property” and must consent to marriage, but questions remain about whether the group that returned to power in mid-August would extend women’s rights around work and education.The decree was announced on Friday by the reclusive Taliban chief, Hibatullah Akhunzada – who is believed to be in the southern city of Kandahar. “Both (women and men) should be equal,” said the decree, adding that “no one can force women to marry by coercion or pressure”.The decree did not mention a minimum age for marriage, which previously was set at 16 years old.The group also said a widow will now be allowed to re-marry 17 weeks after her husband’s death, choosing her new husband freely.Longstanding tribal traditions have held it customary for a widow to marry one of her husband’s brothers or relatives in the event of his death.The Taliban leadership says it has ordered Afghan courts to treat women fairly, especially widows seeking inheritance as next of kin. The group, which came to power in August, also said it had asked government ministers to spread awareness about women’s rights across the population.The development was hailed as a significant step forward by two leading Afghan women, but questions remained about whether the group would extend women’s rights around work and education.“This is big, this is huge … if it is done as it is supposed to be, this is the first time they have come up with a decree like this,” said Mahbouba Seraj, executive director of the Afghan Women’s Skills Development Center speaking from Kabul on a Reuters Next conference panel on Friday.The international community, which has frozen billions of dollars in funds for Afghanistan, has made women’s and human rights a key element of any future engagement with Afghanistan.Seraj said that even before the Taliban took over the country on August 15, Afghan politicians had struggled to form such a clear policy on women’s rights around marriage.“Now what we have to do as the women of this country is we should make sure this actually takes place and gets implemented,” said Seraj.Roya Rahmani, the former ambassador for Afghanistan to the United States, echoed her optimism and added that it was likely partly an attempt to smooth over international fears regarding the group’s track record on women’s rights as the Taliban administration seeks to get funding released.“An amazing thing if it does get implemented,” Rahmani told the Reuters Next panel, adding details such as who would ensure that girls’ consent was not coerced by family members would be key.“It’s a very smart move on the part of Taliban at this point because one of the (pieces of) news that is attracting the West’s attention is the fact little girls are being sold as property to others in order to feed the rest of the family,” she said.During its previous rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban banned women from leaving the house without a male relative and full face and head covering and girls from receiving education, coerced men to grow beards and barred the playing of music.The Taliban says they have changed but many women, advocates and officials remain sceptical.The group promised freedom of expression, women’s rights and amnesty to officials who worked under the previous government of President Ashraf Ghani. But journalists have faced restrictions and reports have emerged of Taliban fighters involved in revenge killings of former officials. A large number of secondary schools for girls are still not operational, though Taliban has said it is working to open them.The US has frozen nearly $10bn in Afghan central bank reserves and international financial institutions have suspended development funding for the country, plunging the heavily aid-dependent economy into crisis and leaving economists and aid groups warning of a humanitarian catastrophe.Seraj said the Taliban now needed to go further, calling for the group to release more rules to clarify women’s rights to access public spaces.“What I am really waiting to hear next from the same group, from the same person is for him to send the decree regarding the education and right of work for the women of Afghanistan, that would be absolutely phenomenal,” she said.Also speaking on the panel, Ahmad Sarmast, the founder and director of Afghanistan National Institute of Music, cautioned that the Taliban had shown few signs of change when it came to allowing the arts and freedom of expression.As he facilitated hundreds of students and their families to flee the country and escaped himself to Portugal, the Taliban shuttered his institute and other music and arts faculties in the country.Though the group had not issued their policy on music, he said he was in contact with many Afghan musicians who had hidden their instruments and were living in fear.“There’s not an official decree banning music or music education but the practice is here,” he said. “Music has faded out of the air of Afghanistan.”
The United Arab Emirates and France have signed a $19bn arms deal that will see the Gulf state acquire 80 Rafale fighter jets and 12 military helicopters.The largest-ever overseas sale of Rafale jets was sealed on Friday as French President Emmanuel Macron began a two-day trip to the Gulf, during which he will also visit Qatar and Saudi Arabia.“This contract cements a strategic partnership that is stronger than ever and directly contributes to regional stability,” the French presidency said in a statement after Macron and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (MBZ) signed the deal on the sidelines of the Dubai Expo 2020.Macron’s visit comes at a time when Gulf Arab states have voiced uncertainty about the United States’s focus on the region even as they seek more weapons from their key security ally.The French leader has forged a good relationship with MBZ with investments flowing between the two countries.The deal will directly support 7,000 jobs in France and guarantee the supply chain of the Dassault Aviation-made aircraft until the end of 2031, a French official told journalists.He also said the UAE contract, which follows deals in Greece, Egypt and Croatia this year, would lead to an increase of the monthly Rafale production.Shares in Dassault Aviation SA, the Rafale’s maker, rose more than 9 percent.The F4 model Rafales, currently under development, will be delivered from 2027.By snapping up the fighter craft, the UAE is following the lead of Gulf rival Qatar, which has bought 36 of the planes.The on-off negotiations for the Rafale fighter jets took more than 10 years with Abu Dhabi publicly rebuffing France’s offer to supply 60 Rafale jets in 2011 as “uncompetitive and unworkable”. Abu Dhabi already has French-built Mirage 2000 warplanes.Defence sources said the Rafale would replace the Mirage 2000 fleet but is unlikely to displace the American-built F-35 as the UAE continues to hedge its security with two main suppliers, France and the United States.The deal could nonetheless be seen as a signal of impatience as the US Congress hesitates on approving an F-35 deal amid concerns about the UAE’s relationship with China, including the prevalence of Huawei 5G technology in the country.Abu Dhabi also ordered 12 Caracal helicopters. It is the French code name for the H225M, the multi-role military version of the Super Puma.France has deep ties with the UAE and is one of its main arms’ suppliers, but it has faced increasing pressure to review its sales because of the conflict between a Saudi-led military coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen, which has become one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.“France is going ahead with these sales despite the UAE playing a leading role in the atrocity-marred military operations led by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen,” Human Rights Watch said in a statement.“Yet, the UAE ranks as France’s 5th largest arms customer between 2011 and 2020. The French president should denounce the human rights violations in these three countries.”French fighter jets and personnel are also stationed at al-Dhafra Air Base, a key facility outside the Emirati capital of Abu Dhabi that is also home to several thousand United States troops.Months after Macron was elected in 2017, he travelled to the UAE to inaugurate Louvre Abu Dhabi, built under a $1.2bn agreement to share the name and art of the world-famous museum in Paris.In September, Macron hosted Abu Dhabi’s crown prince at the historic Chateau de Fontainebleau outside Paris, which was restored in 2019 with a UAE donation of 10 million euros ($11.3m).Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala sovereign wealth fund also pledged eight billion euros ($9bn) in investments in French businesses, while the license of the UAE capital’s branch of the Louvre art gallery was extended for 10 years to 2047.
The World Health Organisation said Omicron has been detected in 38 countries but there are no reported deaths so far from the new COVID-19 variant.WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier also said it is “commendable” that makers of COVID-19 vaccines are planning for the “likelihood” of needing to adjust their products to protect against the Omicron variant.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan urged people not to panic over the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant and said it was too early to say if COVID-19 vaccines would have to be modified to fight it.Swaminathan said during an interview at the Reuters Next conference on Friday that the right response was to be prepared and cautious and not to panic in face of the new variant.“How worried should we be? We need to be prepared and cautious, not panic, because we’re in a different situation to a year ago,” Swaminathan said.The emergence of the new variant was unwelcome, she said, but added that the world was much better prepared given the development of vaccines since the start of the pandemic.This blog is now closed. These were the main developments on Friday:5 hours ago (20:43 GMT)Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced the first three cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in his state.“Two cases are from the same household, including a vaccinated individual who recently traveled to South Africa and an unvaccinated person who was a close contact of that individual,” the governor said in a statement.“One unrelated case involves a vaccinated individual with no known recent travel history,” the governor said, adding that none of the three individuals were hospitalised.7 hours ago (19:06

Minister Leo Varadkar said.“I don’t think this will be a large number of people, maybe in the thousands,” who will be eligible, Varadkar told a news conference.8 hours ago (18:29 GMT)Russia’s COVID-19 death toll has reached at least 578,020, the third-worst in the world, according to Reuters calculations based on official statistics for October, the country’s deadliest month so far.Russia ranks behind the US and Brazil with about 787,000 and 615,000 deaths respectively, according to Reuters calculations, having overtaken India in October.8 hours ago (18:23 GMT)The Irish government announced strict new limits on the hospitality sector and home visits as it moved to push down COVID-19 infection rates after officials warned the new Omicron variant was likely to add to pressure on the health service.“The risks associated with proceeding into the Christmas period without some restrictions … is just too high,” Prime Minister Micheal Martin said in a televised address.8 hours ago (18:01 GMT)The emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is the “ultimate evidence” of the danger of unequal vaccination rates around the world, the head of the Red Cross said.“The scientific community has warned the international community on several occasions about the risks of very new variants in places where there is a very low rate of vaccinations,” Francesco Rocca, the president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told the AFP news agency in an interview in Moscow.About 65 percent of people in high-income countries have had at least one dose of vaccine against the coronavirus, but just over seven percent in low-income countries, UN numbers show.Western countries have been accused of hoarding vaccines and the WHO has urged them to avoid a rush to give out booster shots when millions worldwide have yet to receive a single dose.“This is a selfish approach coming from the Western community, this is really a blind approach,” Rocca said.8 hours ago (17:55 GMT)The number of COVID-19 infections topped three million in South Africa as new daily infections driven by the Omicron variant rose steeply, official figures showed.A leading epidemiologist Salim Abdool Karim had earlier this week forecast that coronavirus cases in the continent’s worst-hit country, could see daily infections more than triple this week to more than 10,000.On Friday 16,055 new cases were reported in a 24-hour reporting cycle, taking the cumulative laboratory-confirmed cases to 3,004,203.8 hours ago (17:38 GMT)Zimbabwe has identified 50 cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant, Deputy Health Minister John Mangwiro said, as the government announced it would start offering booster shots to frontline workers, the elderly and people with chronic illnesses.Most of the Omicron cases were detected at a teacher training college as well as the country’s under-17 football team that was due to participate at a regional tournament, Mangwiro told reporters.“From the outbreak that we detected from Masvingo Teachers College and the Under 17 soccer team, we took 20 samples from the college and 22 samples from the soccer team, they all tested positive for the Omicron variant,” he said, adding that the other 8 cases were found in random samples.9 hours ago (17:10 GMT)Omicron has been detected in 38 countries but there are no reported deaths so far from the new COVID-19 variant, the World Health Organisation said.A WHO spokesman told reporters that the UN health agency had “not seen reports of Omicron-related deaths yet”.And Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on COVID-19, said Omicron had been reported in 38 countries, with the variant now spread across all six WHO regions.The WHO has said it will take several weeks to determine how infectious Omicron is, and to assess how vaccines, tests and treatments hold up against it.9 hours ago (17:01 GMT)Tunisia reported its first infection from the new coronavirus variant Omicron, Health Minister Ali Mrabet told local media.The minister said the infected person was a 23-year-old man from Congo who came to Tunisia from Istanbul airport.9 hours ago (16:53 GMT)At least 13 people in Oslo have been infected with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus following a corporate Christmas party in the capital, and more cases are expected to be confirmed, local authorities said.The outbreak took place at a Christmas party on November 26 organised by renewable energy company Scatec, which has operations in South Africa where the variant was first detected.9 hours ago (16:48 GMT)Six cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 have been found in Nebraska, the state’s health department said, marking the sixth US state with confirmed cases.One case involved a traveller who returned from Nigeria on November 23, while the other five cases were likely exposed through household contact with that individual, the department said.Only one of the six individuals was vaccinated and none have needed to be hospitalized, it said.9 hours ago (16:46 GMT)The first case of the Omicron variant of coronavirus has been confirmed in Mexico, the country’s deputy health minister said.9 hours ago (16:45 GMT)Health officials in Britain said they were investigating a rise this week in the number of COVID-19 tests results that have a trait that is associated with the newly identified Omicron coronavirus variant of concern.One of Omicron’s mutations produces S-gene target failure (SGTF) in about half the PCR tests in use in Britain, allowing it to be distinguished from Delta and providing a clue over the spread of Omicron before full genomic sequencing.Although a useful early indicator of the spread of Omicron, SGTF is associated with other variants too, such as Alpha.“The proportion of test results displaying SGTF has been very low in recent months but an increase has been observed in the past week,” UK Health Security Agency said.“This is still a very small number of cases but is being investigated carefully to understand whether it is related to travel, any other variant or whether there is evidence of spread of Omicron beginning in the community.”10 hours ago (16:08 GMT)Britain reported 50,584 further cases of COVID-19 and 143 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to official data.That compares with 53,945 cases and 141 deaths reported a day earlier.11 hours ago (15:32 GMT)French biotech firm Valneva said that no conclusions should be drawn on the effectiveness of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, known as VLA2001,  from a new British study on booster shots.The study said COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna that use mRNA technology provide the biggest boost to antibody levels when given 10-12 weeks after the second dose.Traders cited the study as the reason behind a fall of up to 24 percent in Valneva’s shares on Friday.“The setting in this study leads us to believe that COV-Boost does not allow any conclusions to be reached regarding the use of VLA2001 as a booster in a real-life setting,” Valneva said in an e-mailed statement in response to a Reuters query.“Valneva believes it is likely that the short interval between the second shot and booster shot could have adversely impacted the results for VLA2001, given that a longer interval is generally required for inactivated vaccines.”11 hours ago (15:10 GMT)It is “commendable” that makers of COVID-19 vaccines are planning for the “likelihood” of needing to adjust their products to protect against the Omicron variant, a World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson said.Christian Lindmeier, speaking at a UN briefing in Geneva, said the agency was still studying the transmissibility and severity of the new variant, first reported in Southern Africa.“It is very commendable that vaccine manufacturers already start planning ahead and plan for the likelihood for having to adjust the existing vaccine,” he said. “That’s good not just to wait until the final alarm bell rings.”11 hours ago (15:03 GMT)Belgium tightened its coronavirus restrictions for the third consecutive week to fight one of Europe’s worst spikes of COVID-19 cases, but stopped short of the strict curbs imposed in the neighbouring Netherlands or Austria.“We cannot allow the train of infection that is thundering through our country to continue at its current pace,” Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told a news conference.With cases among children rising the most, De Croo said mask mandates will apply from age six. The current requirement to wear a mask is for those aged 10 years and older.Primary schools will shut for Christmas and New Year holidays a week earlier and secondary schools will shift to a hybrid system, with half of classes from home.By contrast, bars and restaurants in Belgium, home to EU institutions and NATO, will still be able to open until 11pm local time, six hours later than in the Netherlands.11 hours ago (14:58 GMT)The Czech Health Ministry is preparing a decree ordering COVID-19 vaccination for people over 60 and several professions including medical workers, police officers and firefighters, news website www.idnes.cz reported.11 hours ago (14:49 GMT)Dutch health authorities said that a significant number of passengers on flights from South Africa over the past week have tested positive for COVID-19 on arrival despite having been vaccinated and testing negative before departure.“It shows that the virus is spreading easily and that is worrying,” said Bert van de Velden, director of the regional health authority for Kennemerland, which includes Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport.12 hours ago (14:30 GMT)The Scottish government said it expected cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant to rise significantly in upcoming days as there was now community transmission of the strain.“The number of Omicron cases now being reported in Scotland is rising, and cases are no longer all linked to a single event, but to several different sources including a Steps concert,” said Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon after the number of cases of the variant in Scotland increased to 29.“This confirms our view that there is now community transmission of this variant within Scotland. Given the nature of transmission we would expect to see cases rise – perhaps significantly – in the days ahead.”12 hours ago (14:20 GMT)The United States sent 9 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine doses to countries in Africa and another 2 million doses to other nations, the White House said.“Today, we are shipping 9 million vaccine doses to Africa and another 2 million worldwide. We need every country to step up with the same urgency and ambition as the US,” White House Spokesman Kevin Munoz said in a post on Twitter.12 hours ago (14:15 GMT)At least 17 people who caught COVID-19 after a Christmas party with more than 100 guests in Oslo last week are suspected of having the Omicron variant, officials said.The number is likely to grow as sequencing is carried out on other positive tests from partygoers.“So far, 60 people have tested positive [for COVID] with PCR tests, and four with antigen tests,” the city of Oslo said in a statement.“Seventeen are probably Omicron, but that has yet to be confirmed. So far, one case is confirmed to be Omicron after sequencing.”The Oslo cluster comes as fears rise that Omicron, which South Africa reported to the World Health Organization on November 24, could be more transmissible and more resistant to vaccines than other strains.12 hours ago (14:05 GMT)Switzerland announced it was dropping 10-day quarantine rules for people flying in from countries where the Omicron COVID-19 variant has been detected.The wealthy Alpine nation – one of Europe’s top skiing holiday destinations — said the rule no longer made sense now that the variant is also circulating in Switzerland.Swiss ski resorts are heavily reliant on winter tourists from Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands – three countries which had been on the quarantine list.“All countries are removed from the quarantine list as of Saturday,” the government said.Everyone entering Switzerland must present a negative PCR test, except those crossing the border from neighbouring Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Liechtenstein.12 hours ago (13:58 GMT)Germany is likely to see a sharp rise in the number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients in the next three weeks, acting Health Minister Jens Spahn warned.Speaking at a news conference in Berlin, Spahn said the recently agreed measures will show their impact only after a couple of weeks, while an upward trend in hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions still continues.“The situation in intensive care units is likely to reach a tragic peak around Christmas,” he said, adding that many hospitals in coronavirus hotspots are already overwhelmed and have run out of ICU beds.He urged citizens to follow hygiene and social distancing rules and avoid unnecessary contact with others to stem the spread of the virus.12 hours ago (13:52 GMT)An Italian man turned up at a vaccination centre wearing a fake silicone arm, hoping to fool a nurse into giving him a jab in order to obtain a COVID-19 health certificate, local authorities said.The man, who is in his 50s, has been reported to police in the northern city of Biella, regional governor Alberto Cirio said, adding that the silicone on the prosthetic arm looked “very similar” to real skin.“[However] the colour and touch raised the suspicion of the health worker, who asked him to show the whole arm,” Cirio said.“The incident would border on the ridiculous, were it not for the fact that we are talking about an extremely serious act,” Cirio said in a post on Facebook.Ansa news agency reported that the man, who has not been named, worked in the health sector and had been suspended from his job because he had refused to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The jab is mandatory for all health workers.12 hours ago (13:40 GMT)The estimated range of England’s COVID-19 weekly reproduction “R” number is between 0.9 and 1.1, lower than last week, the UK Health Security Agency said.An R number between 0.9 and 1.1 means that for every 10 people infected, they will on average infect between 9 and 11 other people.
