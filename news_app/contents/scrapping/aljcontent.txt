New cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant have been detected around the world, with two cases reported in Australia, and more countries try to seal themselves off by imposing travel restrictions.First discovered in South Africa, Omicron has since been recorded in the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Botswana, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, and the United Kingdom.The discovery of Omicron, dubbed a “variant of concern” on Friday by the World Health Organization, sparked worries that it could resist vaccines and prolong the nearly two-year COVID pandemic.Omicron is potentially more contagious than previous variants, but experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe COVID-19.Countries have imposed a wave of travel bans or curbs on southern Africa. In the most far-reaching effort to keep the variant at bay, Israel announced late on Saturday it would ban the entry of all foreigners and reintroduce counterterrorism phone-tracking technology to contain the spread of the variant.Here are the latest updates:12 mins ago (12:57 GMT)Denmark has registered two cases of the new Omicron coronavirus variant in travellers from South Africa, according to the country’s infectious disease authority.“This was to be expected, and our strategy is therefore to continue intensive monitoring of the infection in the country,” Henrik Ullum, director of the State Serum Institute, said in a statement.The two persons, travelling to Denmark by plane, have been put in isolation and authorities are tracing any close contacts.14 mins ago (12:55 GMT)Disbelief and confusion washed over South Africa as the announcement of the discovery of the Omicron COVID-19 variant grounded flights and raised fears of a hard lockdown in Africa’s most developed economy.Flights from the country to the United States, United Kingdom, and nations in Europe were swiftly banned after South African scientists officially announced the discovery of the virus strain on Thursday.Read more here.27 mins ago (12:42 GMT)Dutch health authorities has said that 13 cases of the new Omicron coronavirus variant have been found in the Netherlands among passengers that were on flights from South Africa earlier this week.The National Institute for Health (RIVM) confirmed the cases in a statement.50 mins ago (12:18 GMT)Britain’s government has defended the pace and scale of its response to the new Omicron strain of COVID-19 against criticism that it was again falling behind the curve.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said mandatory mask-wearing will return to shops and public transport in England on Tuesday, and told families to plan for Christmas “as normal”, despite new rules to tackle the Omicron variant.Also from Tuesday, all passengers arriving in Britain are being instructed to take a PCR test for COVID-19, and self-isolate until they register negative.53 mins ago (12:16 GMT)Dutch health authorities say they have detected 61 COVID-19 cases among people who flew in from South Africa.In a statement on Saturday, the Dutch Health Authority (GDD) said that the cases were discovered among 624 passengers who arrived at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport on two flights on Friday.Read more here.59 mins ago (12:10 GMT)Israel says it will ban the entry of all foreigners into the country, making it the first nation to shut its borders completely in response to a new and potentially more contagious coronavirus variant.Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the ban, pending government approval, would last 14 days.Read more here.1 hour ago (11:59 GMT)Swiss voters looked likely to back the government’s pandemic response plan in a referendum, paving the way for continuation of exceptional measures to stem the rising tide of COVID-19 cases.Early government tallies of Sunday’s polls showed a little more than 60 percent of the votes so far supporting the law passed this year to provide financial aid to people hit by the COVID-19 crisis and to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination, recovery or a negative test to enter bars, restaurants and certain events.Restrictions to public life to curb coronavirus infections have sparked opposition in Switzerland, triggering a binding referendum under the country’s system of direct democracy, even as cases have risen to levels the government this week deemed “critical”.2 hours ago (11:38 GMT)Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan have suspended flights with a number of African countries due to Omicron.Saudi state news agency SPA, citing a source with the Interior Ministry, said direct flights with Angola, Comoros, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Seychelles, and Zambia had been suspended.On Friday, the kingdom banned flights from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe amid Omicron fears.Bahrain also banned passengers from Angola Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia, according to the state news agency BNA. Bahraini nationals and holders of valid visas to Bahrain, however, were allowed to enter.Health authorities in Sudan also banned flights from Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe over variant.2 hours ago (11:29 GMT)Omicron is probably already circulating in France, its health minister said, adding that the government was tightening restrictions to contain it.“Once the variant is circulating in England, in Italy, in Belgium, it is probable that there are already cases in circulation here. We will identify them and (…) we will slow down its spread as much as possible,” Olivier Veran told reporters at a vaccination centre in Paris.France is in the midst of a fifth wave of the virus. It recorded more than 37,000 positive cases on Saturday and a sharp rise in the number of patients in intensive care.
Dutch health authorities say they have detected 61 COVID-19 cases among people who flew in from South Africa and say they believe some of the infections are of the new omicron variant.In a statement on Saturday, the Dutch Health Authority (GDD) said that the cases were discovered among 624 passengers who arrived at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport on two flights on Friday.That was before the Dutch government restricted air traffic from southern Africa due to concerns over the variant.“We know that 61 of the results were positive and 531 [were] negative,” the GDD said.A spokesman for the National Institute for Public Health (RVIM) meanwhile said the agency was “almost certain” that the cases were of the new variant, but said further testing was needed to be absolutely sure.The results are expected to be made public on Sunday.Those who tested positive are now being kept in isolation at a hotel near the airport.A spokesperson for KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France, said the passengers on the flight had either tested negative or shown proof of vaccination before getting on planes in Cape Town and Johannesburg.“It goes too far to say we are surprised” by the high number of cases, a KLM spokesperson said. “But we don’t have an explanation.”The spokesperson said it was possible many of the positive cases were among vaccinated people, or that an unusual number of people developed infections after having tested negative.Dutch health authorities were seeking to contact some 5,000 other passengers who have travelled from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia or Zimbabwe since Monday to urge them to take a COVID-19 test as soon as possible.Paula Zimmerman, a Dutch photographer who returned from a family visit in South Africa on Friday morning, said the situation for the passengers on the planes was chaotic, as they were kept waiting on the tarmac and in the terminal for hours.Zimmerman was told she had tested negative at 4 am, almost 18 hours after landing in Amsterdam. But she then found out she was standing right next to a man who discovered he had tested positive.“It was really weird. There was no coordination. There were too few people and there really wasn’t anybody who took control.”Having spent hours on a flight that likely had many infected passengers made Zimmerman anxious for the days to come, she said.“I’ve been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days. It’s a little scary, the idea that you’ve been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive.”New York Times global health reporter Stephanie Nolen also tweeted her ordeal at what she called “Dystopia Central Airline Hallway”.She described how passengers, including babies and toddlers, were crammed together waiting to get tested, while “still 30 percent of people are wearing no mask or only over mouth”.Dutch citizens are still allowed to return home from southern Africa, while European Union citizens are allowed entry in transit to their home countries.Medical staff, airline crews and people with pressing needs are also still allowed to travel. KLM will continue flights to the region, but all travellers must now test negative before departure and then quarantine for at least five days upon arrival in the Netherlands.The new variant has been detected as many European countries grapple with a surge in coronavirus cases.The Dutch government on Friday announced the nighttime closure of bars, restaurants and most stores, as it tries to curb a record-breaking wave of COVID-19 cases that is swamping its healthcare system.
The United Kingdom, Germany and Italy have confirmed their first two cases of the new Omicron strain of coronavirus.The variant has prompted several countries to impose restrictions such as travel bans on several southern African countries, against the advice of the World Health Organization, while others have imposed fresh lockdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19.The Omicron variant, which scientists say has a high number of mutations, was first detected in South Africa last week. Cases have also been reported in travellers in Belgium, Israel and Hong Kong.The mutations in Omicron, also known as B.1.1.529, could help the virus evade the body’s immune response and make it more transmissible, according to scientists. It could take weeks to know if current vaccines are less effective against it.This live blog is now closed. Here were Saturday’s updates:17 hours ago (20:18 GMT)Saudi Arabia has said it will allow entry to travellers “from all countries” as long as they have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine inside the kingdom.The ministry said the travellers would be allowed in from next Saturday and would need to quarantine for three days.Saudi Arabia suspended flights on Friday to and from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho and Eswatini.18 hours ago (19:21 GMT)US President Joe Biden has been briefed on the latest situation regarding the Omicron variant, the White House said.“At the same time, senior health officials and the COVID response team have been monitoring the latest updates on Omicron and in regular touch with health officials around the world,” a White House official said in a statement.18 hours ago (18:59 GMT)Some of 61 COVID-19 cases detected among a group of passengers that arrived in the Netherlands from South Africa this week are likely to be the Omicron variant, health authorities have said.“In a number of the tested persons the Omicron variant is presumed to have been found,” the Netherlands Institute for Public Health (RIVM) said in a statement.A spokesperson for the RIVM said it was “almost certain” the cases were of the new variant but further testing is needed.19 hours ago (18:22 GMT)Kuwait has suspended direct flights from nine African countries, the cabinet has said.The countries include South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zambia and Malawi.19 hours ago (18:13 GMT)Italy says it has detected its first case of Omicron in a traveller from Mozambique.“The patient and the members of their family are in good health,” the national health institute said in a statement.19 hours ago (18:06 GMT)UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced “temporary and precautionary” measures to be reviewed in three weeks, alongside a “boost” to the booster campaign.Mask rules will be mandatory in shops and on public transport in the UK, Omicron contacts will have to self-isolate and new arrivals will have to quarantine until they test negative for coronavirus.Johnson warned the new variant could reduce the effectiveness of vaccines, as he announced a strengthening of England’s rules at a Downing Street press conference, after the infections were identified in Nottingham, and Brentwood in Essex.19 hours ago (18:01 GMT)The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and State Department have advised against travel to eight southern African countries after the White House announced new travel restrictions.The CDC raised its travel recommendation to “Level Four: Very High” for South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi, Lesotho, Eswatini and Botswana while the State Department issued parallel “Do Not Travel” advisories.On Monday, the CDC had lowered its COVID-19 travel advisory for South Africa to “Level 1: Low.”19 hours ago (17:44 GMT)Two cases of the Omicron variant have been detected in the southern German state of Bavaria, the regional health ministry has said.The two infected people entered Germany at Munich airport on November 24, before Germany designated South Africa as a virus-variant area, and are now isolating, the ministry said.19 hours ago (17:42 GMT)Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the UK is still in a “much, much stronger position” to tackle the Omicron variant because of its vaccination programme.“There’s nothing that we’ve announced tonight that changes for the position for hospitality and … I believe that as a result of the vaccination programme and of the booster programme that is going very, very fast now that the UK is in a much, much stronger position,” he told a news conference.“And it’s in order to retain that strong position that we’re taking the sensible precautionary steps that we are taking today.”20 hours ago (17:34 GMT)UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is confident that Christmas this year would be “considerably better” than the last one, when the government introduced a lockdown to try to stem the spread of COVID-19.“I think I am going to stick with the formula that I’ve used before which is I am pretty confident or absolutely confident that this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas,” he told a news conference.20 hours ago (17:33 GMT)UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has unveiled new measures to try to stop the spread of Omicron, saying all arrivals would have to take a test and it was time to step up booster jabs.“We will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self-isolate until they have a negative result,” Johnson told a news conference.He said those who had come into contact with people testing positive for a suspected case of Omicron would have to self-isolate for 10 days and that the government would tighten up the rules on wearing face coverings.20 hours ago (17:30 GMT)There is a reasonable chance that the newly identified Omicron variant of the coronavirus has some degree of vaccine escape, England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has said.“There is a reasonable chance that at least there will be some degree of vaccine escape with this variant,” Whitty told a news conference, speaking alongside British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.21 hours ago (16:38 GMT)Czech President Miloš Zeman has been discharged from the capital’s military hospital after testing positive for the coronavirus.Zeman, 77, had already been discharged following more than a month’s treatment for an unspecified illness on Thursday, but was readmitted only hours later after testing positive for the coronavirus.The president received monoclonal antibodies, a standard treatment for people belonging to risk groups. He is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, including a booster. Zeman has no symptoms of COVID-19, the hospital said.21 hours ago (16:21 GMT)Germany’s health minister has said he hopes that the sight of air force planes transferring patients across the country will act as a “wake-up call” to millions who are still holding out on getting vaccinated against COVID-19.Health Minister Jens Spahn said there has been a welcome increase over the past week in the number of people getting their first shots, with 450,000 recorded. He put that down to pressure from Germany’s worsening coronavirus situation and to increasing requirements for people to provide proof of vaccination or recent recovery to take part in many activities.But it is still not enough and “this figure of nearly 12 million unvaccinated adults is still far, far too high,” Spahn said at an online town hall event. So far, 68.4 percent of the population of 83 million people is fully vaccinated, below the 75 percent minimum threshold eyed by the government.21 hours ago (16:10 GMT)Speaking to NBC’s Today show, chief White House medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci has said blocking travel from southern Africa is done to “give us time to assess [Omicron] better”.“We have not detected it yet but when you have a virus that is showing this degree of transmissibility and you’re already having travel-related cases that they’ve noted in Israel, Belgium and other places … it almost invariably is ultimately going to go all over,” Fauci said.“The issue of blocking travel from a given country is just to give us time to assess it better. That’s the reason for doing that. Not any reason to panic, but we want to give us some time to really fill in the blanks of what we don’t know right now.”22 hours ago (15:19 GMT)The German state of Bavaria is operating further transfer flights across Germany for hospitals overwhelmed by the COVID-19 crisis.Two patients were being flown from the Bavarian capital, Munich, to Hamburg in the north, and others to Cologne, Dusseldorf and Dortmund in the west. Another three were to be taken by ambulance to hospitals in the states of Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate in the southwest.Other flights have been operated using privately owned air ambulances. In total, some 30 intensive care patients are due to be flown out of Bavaria by Sunday evening.22 hours ago (15:04 GMT)England will also add Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola to its travel “red list” from 4:00 GMT on Sunday, meaning British and Irish residents who arrive in the country must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days. Non-residents will be refused entry.The list already contained Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty will hold a news conference later on Saturday “to set out further measures”, UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said.23 hours ago (14:33 GMT)Mauritius will suspend all commercial passenger flights from South Africa from November 28, its foreign affairs ministry has said.A ministry statement also said any passengers who have been physically present in South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini and Zimbabwe will be denied entry or transit through Mauritius.23 hours ago (14:31 GMT)The Omicron variant has probably arrived in Germany, a minister in the western state of Hesse has said, after mutations were found in a passenger arriving from South Africa.“Last night several Omicron-typical mutations were found in a traveller returning from South Africa,” tweeted Kai Klose, social affairs minister in Hesse, home to Frankfurt airport, Germany’s biggest hub and one of Europe’s busiest airports.He added a full sequencing of the variant was being carried out and the person was isolating. Anyone who has travelled from South Africa in the last few weeks should limit contact and get tested, he said.23 hours ago (14:29 GMT)South Korea has said it will restrict arrivals from South Africa and seven other nations.The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said that from November 28 the issuance of visas for those from eight nations in southern Africa would be restricted while South Korean citizens returning from the region would be quarantined.The eight countries subject to the new restrictions are South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi.23 hours ago (14:12 GMT)Two cases of the Omicron variant have been detected in the UK, health minister Sajid Javid has said.“Late last night I was contacted by the UK Health Security Agency. I was informed that they have detected two cases of this new variant, Omicron, in the United Kingdom. One in Chelmsford, the other in Nottingham,” he said in a broadcast clip.“We have moved rapidly and the individuals are self-isolating while contact tracing is ongoing,” Javid said in a statement.23 hours ago (13:44 GMT)The rugby international between the Barbarians and Samoa has been called off only 90 minutes before kickoff at Twickenham, UK, due to six confirmed cases of the coronavirus among the Barbarians players and staff.The decision was made following a recommendation by the Professional Game Testing Oversight Group, the Rugby Football Union said.“We appreciate that this is an extremely disappointing situation for the many fans due to attend,” the RFU said, “but the safety of all members of both teams is our priority.”24 hours ago (13:35 GMT)An immunology professor has spoken about the threat posed by the Omicron variant and how it could be countered.Talking to UK broadcaster Sky News, Professor Danny Altmann said that “if you look at the straight molecular biology limitations, it looks potentially quite a lot scarier even than Delta” but that there were no reports yet from South Africa that cases were more severe.Altmann also spoke about how “foolhardy” it was that the African continent had not received similar amounts of vaccine compared with Europe or North America, thus increasing the risk of new variants spreading quickly.24 hours ago (13:17 GMT)Hungary will impose restrictions on travellers from Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, the government has said.Hungary said it was joining a European Union move to curb air travel from southern Africa and that its measures would be published in a government decree later in the day.Hello, this is Mersiha Gadzo taking over the live blog from my colleague Farah Najjar.27 Nov 2021 - 12:02 GMTThe women’s cricket World Cup qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe has been abandoned after the discovery of the Omicron coronavirus variant in South Africa, the sport’s governing body said.The International Cricket Council (ICC) took the decision after Saturday’s game between the West Indies and Sri Lanka was called off when a member of the Sri Lankan support staff tested positive for COVID-19.“We are incredibly disappointed to have to cancel the remainder of this event,” Chris Tetley, the ICC’s head of events, said in a statement.“But with travel restrictions from a number of African countries being imposed at such short notice, there was a serious risk that teams would be unable to return home.“We have explored a number of options to allow us to complete the event but it isn’t feasible and we will fly the teams out of Zimbabwe as soon as possible.”27 Nov 2021 - 11:51 GMTSouth Africa has said that it is being “punished” for detecting the new Omicron coronavirus variant.South Africa’s foreign ministry said in a statement that moves by many countries to ban flights from southern Africa following the discovery of the variant “is akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker”.“Excellent science should be applauded and not punished,” it said.The ministry pointed out that new variants had been discovered in other parts of the world.“Each of those cases have had no recent links with Southern Africa, but the reaction to those countries is starkly different to cases in Southern Africa,” it said.27 Nov 2021 - 11:13 GMTCardiff, Scarlets and Munster face quarantine and fixture disruption as they remained stuck in South Africa, hoping to leave this weekend despite travel bans.The two Welsh clubs are unlikely to beat the Sunday deadline, set by the UK government on travellers from South Africa, to avoid hotel quarantine.They had tried to charter a flight home on Friday but were refused permission by the United Kingdom’s Civil Aviation Authority, Cardiff and Scarlets said.Cardiff said their players remained in good spirits at their Cape Town base while efforts to repatriate them were continuing. Scarlets said their players had returned negative tests but were following strict COVID-19 protocols.Munster’s players will have to isolate at home for 10 days once they return to Ireland, where quarantine regulations are less restrictive, but all three teams face a knock-on effect with their fixtures.27 Nov 2021 - 11:09 GMTQatar Airways said it has banned entry to travellers from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique due to the spread of the new COVID-19 variant.27 Nov 2021 - 11:03 GMTThe British scientist who led the research underpinning AstraZeneca’s coronavirus jab said a new vaccine could be developed against the emerging Omicron variant “very rapidly” if needed.Professor Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, also said existing vaccines should work against the new strain, but that would only become apparent after more research in the coming weeks.“It’s extremely unlikely that a reboot of a pandemic in a vaccinated population like we saw last year [with the Delta variant] is going to happen,” he told BBC radio.But if required, “The processes of how one goes about developing a new vaccine are increasingly well-oiled, so if it’s needed that is something that could be moved very rapidly.”27 Nov 2021 - 11:01 GMTThe Czech Republic is examining a suspected case of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus detected in a person who spent time in Namibia, the National Institute of Public Health said.“A lab is checking a possible find of a positive specimen of the Omicron variant. We are awaiting confirmation or refutation of the case,” spokeswoman Stepanka Cechova said in an emailed statement.27 Nov 2021 - 10:23 GMTA minister in the German state of Hesse said that the Omicron COVID-19 variant had very probably arrived in Germany.“Last night several Omicron-typical mutations were found in a traveller returning from South Africa,” tweeted Kai Klose, the social affairs minister in the western German state that is home to Frankfurt airport.He added that a full sequencing of the variant was being carried out.27 Nov 2021 - 10:21 GMTAl Jazeera’s Fahmida Miller, reporting from Johannesburg, said South Africa’s leaders are trying to reverse the travel bans, which many scientists regard as being unnecessary.“That outcry comes specifically from scientists and the government in South Africa who have certainly been frustrated in the last 24-48 hours, saying that simply because South Africa has done its work and been transparent [in presenting its findings], now South Africa is being punished by being put on the red list. [They say] it is unjustified and it has created unnecessary panic,” she said.“There is concern about the impact that these bans will have on South Africa – especially given the difficulties the economy has gone through throughout this pandemic and ahead of the holiday season when travellers come from Europe and the United Kingdom and bring in millions of dollars worth of revenue.”27 Nov 2021 - 10:18 GMTIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told officials to review plans to ease travel restrictions as concerns rise over the new variant.The world’s second-worst affected country by the pandemic had only on Friday decided to resume international passenger flights from countries deemed “at risk” of the coronavirus, while ordering tightened border screening.But after the WHO declared the new variant to be “of concern”, Modi “highlighted the need for monitoring all international arrivals, their testing as per guidelines, with a specific focus on countries identified ‘at risk’,” the government said in a statement after he met with officials to review the COVID-19 and vaccination situation.Modi said people must be more cautious and take proper precautions, such as wearing masks and social distancing. He “spoke about the need to be proactive in light of the new variant,” the statement said.27 Nov 2021 - 09:34 GMTOksana Pyzik, a global health adviser and a lecturer at teaching fellow at University College London’s School of Pharmacy, told Al Jazeera that vaccine inequality will likely lead to more coronavirus variants as the pandemic is prolonged and that a more coordinated international approach towards vaccine distribution is needed.“The World Health Organization has been warning repeatedly for months on end … that if vaccine inequity continues, if we continue to have high-income countries hoarding vaccines such that entire continents are left with very limited access to vaccines, this will inevitably lead to a [more powerful] virus, a potentially vaccine-resistant virus,” she said.Pyzik said that less than 3.5 percent of people across the continent of Africa have been vaccinated against COVID-19.“So only focusing on high-income regions has been a short term view of the issue, and we have also taken for granted that Delta is the worst variant that we could come across and now we have evidence that points otherwise – of course it is early days, but what scientists have come across is deeply worrying.”27 Nov 2021 - 09:30 GMTCornerlia Meyer, an economist and oil analyst, said oil prices fell more than 10 percent.“That was probably an overreaction, it’s always overshoot and undershoot,” Meyer told Al Jazeera.“But it shows real awareness amongst traders … in terms of what does this mean … what will that mean for air travel,” she said.“Should this variant spread, and if transatlantic routes close down again, that would be bad.”To read more about the crash, click here.27 Nov 2021 - 09:15 GMTMaria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead for COVID-19, said despite people’s concern over the Omicron variant, the good thing is that “we have monitoring systems around the world to detect these variants very quickly”.“This variant was detected a few weeks ago, and already, scientists are sharing research with us … so that we can take action,” she told Al Jazeera.27 Nov 2021 - 09:05 GMTBritain should cut the gap between the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccination and the booster jab from six to five months, Britain’s main opposition Labour Party said.“This new variant is a wake-up call,” said Labour’s junior health spokesman Alex Norris. “The pandemic is not over. We need to urgently bolster our defences to keep the virus at bay.”27 Nov 2021 - 09:01 GMTJapan will tighten border controls for the southern African nations of Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia, requiring a 10-day quarantine for any entrants, the Foreign Ministry said.The new rules will take effect from midnight (15:00 GMT on Saturday) and come a day after Japan tightened border controls for those arriving from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Lesotho.27 Nov 2021 - 08:39 GMTDutch health authorities said that 61 people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa on Friday tested positive for COVID-19, and they were conducting further testing early Saturday to see if any of the infections are with the Omicron variant.“Travelers with a positive test result will be placed in isolation at a hotel at or near Schiphol,” health authorities said in a statement.“Of the positive test results, we are researching as quickly as possible whether they are the new variant of concern, now named ‘Omicron’.”The Dutch government banned all air travel from southern Africa early on Friday.27 Nov 2021 - 08:12 GMTSri Lanka said it was barring travellers from six Southern African countries on Saturday over concerns about the new Omicron variant of COVID-19.From Monday, travellers will not be allowed into the country from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho and Eswatini, Colombo said in a statement.Travellers who arrived from these six countries over the past two days will have to undergo mandatory 14 days quarantine.27 Nov 2021 - 08:10 GMTThailand said it would ban the entry of people travelling from eight African countries it designated as high-risk for the new Omicron variant of COVID-19.Starting in December, travel from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, will be prohibited, senior health official Opas Karnkawinpong told a news conference.Thailand will not allow travellers from these countries to register to travel to Thailand starting on Saturday, he said.“We have notified airlines and these countries,” Opas said adding that travellers from other African countries will not be allowed to use the country’s quarantine-free travel scheme for vaccinated travellers.South Africa’s numbers are still relatively low, with 2,828 new confirmed cases recorded on Friday, but Omicron’s speed in infecting young South Africans has alarmed health professionals.“We’re seeing a marked change in the demographic profile of patients with COVID-19,” Dr Rudo Mathivha, the head of the intensive care unit at Soweto’s Baragwanath Hospital, told an online press briefing.“Young people, in their 20s to just over their late 30s, are coming in with moderate to severe disease, some needing intensive care. About 65 percent are not vaccinated and most of the rest are only half-vaccinated,” said Mathivha.She said urgent preparations are needed to enable public hospitals to cope with a potentially large influx of patients needing intensive care.
Sudan’s military says several Sudanese soldiers were killed in an attack by Ethiopian forces in a disputed border region.In a statement on Saturday, Sudan’s military said “our forces tasked with securing the harvest in Al-Fashaqa… were attacked by groups of Ethiopian army forces and militias, who sought to intimidate farmers and spoil the harvest season.”Sudanese troops “repelled the attack” and “inflicted heavy losses in lives and equipment” on the Ethiopian side, it said.But the attack left “several killed” among Sudanese forces, it said, without giving a death toll.The Reuters news agency, citing military sources, said at least six soldiers had been killed in the attack.Ethiopian officials could not be immediately reached for comment.Al-Fashaqa is a border zone long cultivated by Ethiopian farmers but claimed by Sudan.The zone, which also borders Ethiopia’s troubled Tigray region, has seen sporadic deadly clashes between the two sides over the past years, but escalated last year.Tensions rose after fighting erupted in Tigray in November 2020 and sent tens of thousands of refugees fleeing into Sudan.Khartoum and Addis Ababa have since been locked in a tense war of words over the region, trading accusations of violence and territorial violations.The border dispute feeds into wider tensions in the region, including over Ethiopia’s controversial Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile.Sudan, along with Egypt, has been locked in a bitter dispute over the mega-dam for a decade.Both downstream countries, dependent on the river for most of their water, see it as an existential threat.
The prime minister of the riot-hit Solomon Islands vowed on Sunday to defy pressure to resign, saying violence that swept the capital had been orchestrated by a few people with “evil intention” to topple him.“It is very clear that the recent events were well planned and orchestrated to remove me as the prime minister for unsubstantiated reasons,” Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said in an address broadcast to the Pacific island nation.“I want to show the nation that the government is fully intent and nothing will move us. We must and will never bow down to the evil intention of a few people,” Sogavare said.Sogavare previously blamed the three days of violence — during which rioters incinerated swathes of the capital Honiara before the unrest died down at the weekend — on an unscrupulous few leading others astray with false information.“We must stand up to intimidation, bullying and violence. We owe this to our children and the majority of our people who cannot defend themselves,” he said.Sogavare said the violence, centred on the capital’s Chinatown, had caused 200 million Solomon Islander dollars ($25m) in damage and destroyed 1,000 jobs in an economy already squeezed by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Clean-up operations started in the capital as soldiers and police from Australia and Papua New Guinea helped to restore calm after several days of deadly riots.Residents of Honiara cleared shattered glass, rubble and rubbish from the streets as heavy machinery in the hard-hit district of Chinatown moved rubble from burned-out shops.Mounds of rubbish still lined the streets in the district, a reminder of looting and rioting that broke out following protests over poverty, hunger and Sogavare’s policies.“The situation has calmed down and people are moving about as normal but the environment is still unknown in terms of what may happen,” Red Cross official Kennedy Waitara told the AFP news agency.Waitara said many food shops had been burned down in the riots.“It will not be surprising if we have to experience food shortages and a hike in prices,” he said.“Unemployment will certainly increase in the coming weeks as people will certainly be out of jobs now and will be finding it difficult.”The riots broke out on Wednesday after protesters attempted to storm the Pacific island nation’s parliament, prompting the police to fire tear gas. Demonstrators then set fire to buildings, including a police station and shops.Sogavare declared a 36-hour curfew in Honiara and asked for help from his country’s neighbours. Australia and Papua New Guinea sent 150 peacekeepers on Thursday and Friday, helping to quell the unrest in the nation of 800,000 people.Police arrested more than 100 people and on Friday reported the first deaths from the rioting. They said the charred remains of three people had been found in a burned-out shop in Chinatown and that a forensic team was working to identify the bodies.Despite the uneasy calm, many people in the capital were too nervous to even attend church services, said Nason Ta’ake, a youth leader at the Wesley United Church in Honiara.“There are only a few people attending church services as most are still living in fear,” Ta’ake told AFP.After leaving church, parishioners began scouring shops for food and essential goods but very few were open, he said.An early estimate of the cost of the rioting, released this weekend by the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands, said 56 buildings in the capital had been burned and looted, with many businesses facing a recovery of more than a year.The loss to the economy was expected to be at least $28m, with the bank’s governor warning that the nation’s accounts – already struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic – had been further weakened by the riots.In neighbouring Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said more Australian Federal Police would arrive in the Solomon Islands on Sunday, and added that he expected Fiji to also contribute troops.“Although things are very unstable at this point … plans, we know, are being made, to ensure there can be calm,” he said.The Australian leader said it was up to the Solomon Islands to resolve the crisis.“It is not for us to be interfering in their democracy. It is not for us to be interfering in how they resolve those issues,” Morrison said, stating that Australian forces aimed only to provide a safe environment for this to happen.Many Solomon Islanders believe their government is corrupt and beholden to Beijing and other foreign interests.Opposition leaders on Saturday called for a vote of no confidence in Sogavare.They may not yet have enough votes to pass the motion and remove him from office, but the move could create another flashpoint.The pro-Beijing leader claimed foreign powers opposed to his 2019 decision to switch the Solomons’ diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China were behind the disturbances.But others pointed to inter-island tensions and widespread joblessness among the country’s population – 40 percent of whom are under 14 years of age.China’s government on Friday condemned the violence and vowed to “safeguard the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and institutions”.
