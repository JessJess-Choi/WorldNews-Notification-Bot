Weeks after sailing warships around Japan’s main island, the Chinese and Russian militaries have sent bomber flights into Japanese and South Korean air defence zones, forcing Seoul to scramble its fighter jets in response.In Tokyo on Tuesday, Japan’s Defence Minister Kishi Nobuo met reporters to express “grave concern” over the joint patrols, which took place last week, saying Beijing and Moscow’s moves clearly indicate that the “security situation surrounding Japan is growing more severe”.As he spoke, his Chinese and Russian counterparts were holding virtual talks, where they lauded the air and naval drills as “major events” and inked a new pact to further deepen defence ties.The roadmap, signed by Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and his Chinese vis-à-vis Wei Fenghe, capped a year that has seen an unprecedented growth in military cooperation, including large-scale war games in China’s Ningxia in August, when Russian troops became the first foreign forces to join a regular Chinese drill, as well as announcements to jointly develop military helicopters, missile attack warning systems and even a research station on the moon.“It’s the strongest, closest and best relationship that the two countries have had since at least the mid-1950s. And possibly ever,” said Nigel Gould-Davies, Senior Fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).Noting that China-Russia relations have historically been marked by mutual wariness, including a border conflict in the 1960s that reportedly pushed Beijing and Moscow to the brink of nuclear war, Gould-Davies said the current state of affairs is “exceptional”. Ties have “developed very rapidly, really within the past 10 years,” he said, accelerating in the wake of Western sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea in 2014.It is not only on defence that the two have moved closer but also on the diplomatic and economic fronts.On foreign policy, Beijing and Moscow share similar approaches to Iran, Syria and Venezuela, and recently revived a push to lift United Nations sanctions on North Korea.China’s President Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin have a personal rapport, too, having met more than 30 times since 2013. The Chinese leader has even called Putin his “best friend”.For China, Russia is the biggest supplier of its weapons and the second-largest source of its oil imports. And for Russia, China is its top country trading partner and a key source of investment in its energy projects, including the Yamal LNG plant in the Arctic Circle and the Power of Siberia pipeline, a $55bn gas project that is the largest in Russian history.Gould-Davies of the IISS said the main driver behind all of this is China and Russia’s hostility towards liberal democratic values.“Both countries are ruled by anti-democratic regimes that share a strong common interest in resisting the influence of liberal Western values within their own countries,” he told Al Jazeera. “They also have a strong shared interest in undermining the states and alliances, beyond their own borders, that embody liberal values. So, their main common interest is in effect, an ideological one – they seek to undermine the democratic and liberal West.”The deepening of ties has indeed worried the West, with American intelligence assessments listing China, Russia and their alignment as the biggest security threats to the United States and NATO, the Western security alliance created in 1949 as a bulwark against the Soviet Union, planning to broaden its focus to address countering both countries.In an interview with the London-based Financial Times last month, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he does not see China and Russia as two separate threats.“China and Russia work closely together,” he said. “This whole idea of distinguishing so much between China, Russia, either the Asia-Pacific or Europe — it is one big security environment and we have to address it all together.”But some say this assessment is too simplistic and could result in “grave mistakes”.“There is no grand conspiracy against the West,” said Bobo Lo, a former Australian diplomat and an independent international relations analyst last month. “What this is, is a classic great power relationship, meaning it’s driven by common interests, rather than shared values,” he said at a virtual talk organised by the US-based Center for Global Security Research.By supporting each other, China and Russia gain “critical dividends”, Lo said, including reinforcing the “legitimacy and stability of their respective regimes”. Defence cooperation allows Moscow to project Russian influence on the world stage, he added, while Beijing is able to gain access to Russia’s advanced military technology and operational experience.The relationship also allows Moscow to “fill the technological gap left by the withdrawal of Western companies in Russia” following sanctions imposed in the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea. “And Chinese investment in technology has been absolutely critical to the realization of Russia’s Arctic LNG projects,” Lo said.Alexander Gabuev at the Carnegie Moscow Center agrees.Ties between Russia and China are “driven by fundamental factors beyond Western control”, he said, noting in a talk in March that the two countries also share a 4,300 kilometre (2,672 mile) border. Due to the border clashes of 1969, “they know how really dangerous and expensive it is to be enemies,” he said.That is why, he said on Twitter last month, NATO’s claim that China and Russia are one challenge, “overstates current level of China-Russia cooperation and nuances”.Both countries are “religious about their strategic autonomy,” he said. And “by lumping China and Russia together as a quasi-alliance that needs to be countered through a unified toolkit, the West risks creating a self-fulfilling prophecy, when dual containment leads to further deepening of China-Russia cooperation, that leads to more US pressure.”🧵 THREAD 🧵@jensstoltenberg interview in @FT marks a shift in @NATO's approach to China-Russia axis. Waking up to the issue is welcome compared to years of ignorance. Yet conclusions based on flawed analysis that overstates 🇨🇳🇷🇺 rapport may lead to some grave mistakes 1/ pic.twitter.com/ZtFOd6z03f— Alexander Gabuev 陳寒士 (@AlexGabuev) October 18, 2021For some, US pressure is the starting point.“Both China and Russia feel the US is a hypocritical aggressor who is intent on diminishing them in order to maintain hegemony,” said Einar Tangen, a Beijing-based political analyst who also works as a commentator for China’s state broadcaster CGTN.US actions in this regard, he said, include branding the two countries as its biggest national security threats, the imposition of sanctions over alleged human rights abuses, as well as the forging of what Beijing and Moscow view as anti-Russia-China alliances.These include the Quad, an informal US-led alliance that includes India, Japan and Australia. The group, which China has denounced as an “Asian NATO”, resumed naval drills last year for the first time in 13 years. The four navies expanded the exercises this year by holding them in two phases in the Philippine Sea and in the Bay of Bengal.Then there is the newly formed security alliance between Australia, the United Kingdom and the US, known as the AUKUS. Announcing the trilateral pact in September, the US and UK said Australia will get nuclear-powered submarines – a move analysts said would allow the Australian navy to patrol the disputed waters of the South China Sea as well as the Taiwan Strait.China condemned the alliance as an “extremely irresponsible” threat to regional stability, while Russia called it a “great challenge to the international nuclear non-proliferation regime”.“These [type of actions] inevitably encourage China to conduct closer cooperation with Russia to seek reciprocal responses to hostile acts,” said Danil Bochkov, an analyst at the Moscow-based Russian International Affairs Council.These responses include the recent joint Chinese-Russian drills in the vicinity of Japan and South Korea, both of whom are US allies.Bochkov said the intensifying rivalry may well result in the re-emergence of the rigid blocs seen during the Cold War, with the US-led community on one side and China, Russia and their allies on the other.“That creates geopolitical stalemate which seems impossible to overcome whatsoever,” he said, “leaving all powers to accumulate their might for worst-case scenario by simultaneously testing each other’s ‘red lines’ with dangerous pinprick-like local face-offs.”
The chief of the World Health Organization has warned that the COVID-19 pandemic is not yet over and that some people were falling into a “false sense of security” after being vaccinated against the virus.In a news briefing in Geneva on Wednesday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said many vaccinated people were thinking – wrongly – that receiving the COVID shot meant they no longer needed to take any other precautions.“In many countries and communities, we are concerned about a false sense of security that vaccines have ended the pandemic, and that people who are vaccinated do not need to take any other precautions,” Tedros told reporters.“Vaccines save lives, but they do not fully prevent transmission,” he added.Media briefing on #COVID19 with @DrTedros https://t.co/YeGyqGK92s— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) November 24, 2021“Data suggest that before the arrival of the Delta variant, vaccines reduced transmission by about 60 percent. With Delta, that has dropped to about 40 percent,” Tedros warned.Delta is now dominant around the world, having all but out-competed other strains.“We cannot say this clearly enough: even if you are vaccinated, continue to take precautions to prevent becoming infected yourself, and infecting someone else who could die.”“That means wearing a mask, maintaining distance, avoiding crowds and meeting others outside if you can, or in a well-ventilated space inside.WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan on Wednesday said that people in Europe were “back to pre-pandemic levels of social mixing” despite an alarming rise in cases and hospitalisations.“The reality is the virus will continue to transmit intensely in that environment,” he told reporters.Europe’s return as the pandemic’s epicentre has been blamed on Delta, a slow vaccine uptake in some nations, colder weather, and the easing of restrictions.“Last week, more than 60 percent of all reported cases and deaths from COVID-19 globally were once again in Europe,” Tedros said.“The sheer number of cases is translating to unsustainable pressure on health systems and exhausted health workers.”Europe recorded more than 2.4 million new cases last week, an 11-percent rise on the week before. In Germany, infections were up 31 percent.WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove said that it was important to take measures during the European holiday period, adding that “social measures do not mean lockdowns”.In the past weeks, riots have broken out in several European countries as more lockdowns and restrictions were introduced in places like Germany, Netherlands and Belgium.Tedros voiced hope that a consensus can be found at World Trade Organization ministerial next week for an IP waiver for pandemic vaccines, already supported by more than 100 countries.The WHO chief said he was encouraged about a “broad consensus” being reached on an international agreement on preventing future pandemics at the UN’s special session of the World Health Assembly, calling it a “unique opportunity”.“The world has treaties to manage other threats; surely countries can agree on the need for a binding pact on the threat of pandemics,” he added.Moreover, the WHO director-general said that while the world continued to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, it “cannot lose sight of the many other threats to health that people face around the world, including antimicrobial resistance.”
NASA launched a mission to deliberately smash a spacecraft into an asteroid – a test-run should humanity ever need to stop a giant space rock from wiping out life on Earth.It may sound like science fiction, but the DART – Double Asteroid Redirection Test – is a real proof-of-concept experiment. It blasted off at 10:21pm on Tuesday (06:21 GMT Wednesday) on board a SpaceX rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.The goal is to slightly alter the trajectory of Dimorphos, a “moonlet” about 160 metres (525 feet) wide that circles a much larger asteroid called Didymos 762 metres (2,500 feet) in diameter. The pair orbit the Sun together.Impact should take place in the third quarter of 2022 when the binary asteroid system is 11 million kilometres (6.8 million miles) from Earth, almost the nearest point they ever get.“What we’re trying to learn is how to deflect a threat,” NASA’s top scientist Thomas Zuburchen said of the $330m project, the first of its kind.To be clear, the asteroids in question pose no threat to the planet. But they belong to a class of bodies known as Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), which approach within 48 million kilometres (30 million miles).NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office is most interested in those larger than 140 metres (460 feet) in size, which have the potential to level entire cities or regions with many times the energy of the average nuclear bomb.There are 10,000 known near-Earth asteroids that size or greater, but none has a significant chance of hitting in the next 100 years. One big caveat: scientists think there are still 15,000 more such objects waiting to be discovered.Planetary scientist Essam Heggy said while the NASA mission sounds like science fiction, the threat to the planet is real if the fate of the dinosaurs 80 million years ago is recalled.“The chances of getting hit again by an asteroid is far from science fiction,” he told Al Jazeera. “Asteroids 100 metres and greater are a threat to the Earth, and we need to quantify our deflection capability to these threats.”Planetary scientists can create miniature impacts in labs and use the results to create sophisticated models about how to divert an asteroid – but models are always inferior to real-world tests.Scientists say the Didymos-Dimorphos system is an “ideal natural laboratory” because Earth-based telescopes can easily measure the brightness variation of the pair and judge the time it takes the moonlet to orbit its big brother.Since the current orbit period is known, the change will reveal the effect of the collision, scheduled to occur between September 26 and October 1, 2022.What is more, since the asteroids’ orbit never intersects Earth, they are thought safer to study.The DART probe, which is a box the size of a large fridge with limousine-sized solar panels on either side, will slam into Dimorphos at more than 24,000 kilometres per hour (15,000 miles per hour).Andy Rivkin, the DART investigation team lead, said the current orbital period is 11 hours and 55 minutes, and the team expects the kick will shave 10 minutes off that time.There is some uncertainty about how much energy will be transferred by the impact because the moonlet’s internal composition and porosity are not known.The more debris that is generated, the more push will be imparted on Dimorphos.“Every time we show up at an asteroid, we find stuff we don’t expect,” said Rivkin.The DART spacecraft also contains sophisticated instruments for navigation and imaging, including the Italian Space Agency’s Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids (LICIACube) to watch the crash and its after-effects.“The CubeSat is going to give us, we hope, the shot – the most spectacular image of DART’s impact and the ejecta plume coming off the asteroid. That will be a truly historic, spectacular image,” said Tom Statler, DART’s programme scientist.The so-called “kinetic impactor” method is not the only way to divert an asteroid, but it is the only technique ready to deploy with current technology.Others that have been hypothesised include flying a spacecraft close by to impart a small gravitational force.Another is detonating a nuclear blast close by – but not on the object itself, as in the films Armageddon and Deep Impact – which would probably create many more perilous objects.Scientists estimate 140-metre asteroids strike once every 20,000 years.Asteroids that are 10km (6 miles) or wider – such as the one that struck 66 million years ago and led to the extinction of most life on Earth, including the dinosaurs – occur every 100-200 million years.DART is the latest of several NASA missions of recent years to explore and interact with asteroids, primordial rocky remnants from the solar system’s formation 4.6 billion years ago.Last month, NASA launched a probe on a voyage to the Trojan asteroid clusters orbiting near Jupiter, while the grab-and-go spacecraft OSIRES-REx is on its way back to Earth with a sample collected last October from the asteroid Bennu.
Sweden’s first female prime minister, Social Democrat Magdalena Andersson, has resigned after less than 12 hours in the top job after the Green Party quit their two-party coalition, stoking political uncertainty.But Andersson said she had told the speaker of parliament she hoped to be appointed prime minister again as the head of a single-party government.The Green Party quit after parliament rejected the coalition’s budget bill.“I have asked the speaker to be relieved of my duties as prime minister,” Andersson told a news conference. “I am ready to be prime minister in a single-party, Social Democrat government.”The Green Party said it would support her in any new confirmation vote in parliament, while the Centre Party promised to abstain, which in practice amounts to the same as backing her candidacy. The Left Party has also said it would back her.The government’s own budget proposal was rejected in favour of one presented by the opposition that includes the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats. Sweden’s third largest party is rooted in a neo-Nazi movement. The vote was 154-143 in favour of the opposition’s budget proposal.Speaker Andreas Norlen said he will contact Sweden’s eight party leaders “to discuss the situation”. On Thursday, he will announce the next steps for the 349-seat parliament.Andersson said that “a coalition government should resign if a party chooses to leave the government. Despite the fact that the parliamentary situation is unchanged, it needs to be tried again.”The approved budget was based on the government’s own proposal but of the 74 billion kronor ($8.2bn) that the government wanted to spend on reforms, just over 20 billion kronor ($2.2bn) will be redistributed next year, Swedish broadcaster SVT said.The approved budget aims at reducing taxes, increasing salaries for police officers and providing more money to different sectors of Sweden’s judiciary system.Andersson’s appointment as prime minister had marked a milestone for Sweden, viewed for decades as one of Europe’s most progressive countries when it comes to gender relations, but which had yet to have a woman in the top political post.Andersson had been tapped to replace Stefan Lofven as party leader and prime minister, roles he relinquished earlier this year.Earlier in the day, 117 politicians voted yes to Andersson, 174 rejected her appointment while 57 abstained and one politician was absent.Under the Swedish Constitution, prime ministers can be named and govern as long as a parliamentary majority – a minimum of 175 lawmakers – is not against them.Sweden’s next general election is scheduled for September 11.
JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on Wednesday that he regretted his remarks that the Wall Street bank would last longer than China’s Communist Party, moving quickly to avoid any long-term fallout.Dimon’s comments had risked jeopardizing JPMorgan’s growth ambitions in China where it won regulatory approval in August to become the first full foreign owner of a securities brokerage in the country. China experts in the United States said his quick apology should ensure no serious damage was done.“I regret and should not have made that comment. I was trying to emphasize the strength and longevity of our company,” Dimon said in a statement issued by the bank.In a later statement, Dimon said: “It’s never right to joke about or denigrate any group of people, whether it’s a country, its leadership, or any part of a society and culture. Speaking in that way can take away from constructive and thoughtful dialogue in society, which is needed now more than ever.”Speaking at a Boston College series of CEO interviews on Tuesday, Dimon said: “I made a joke the other day that the Communist Party is celebrating its 100th year – so is JPMorgan. I’d make a bet that we last longer.”“I can’t say that in China. They are probably listening anyway,” he added.Beijing’s approval for JPMorgan to take full ownership of its securities business was a milestone in the opening up of China’s capital markets after years of gradual moves and pressure from Washington.Beijing sees the involvement of foreign banks as important for China’s domestic financial development, academics say. However, they add, Western companies doing business in China still need to tread carefully.“Dimon’s apology shows the degree of deference foreign businesses have to show to the Chinese government in order to remain in its good graces and maintain access to the country’s markets,” said Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University.“I don’t think this will have any longer term consequences,” said Leland Miller, chief executive at data firm China Beige Book and an expert on China’s financial system.Dimon’s comments sparked reaction from commentators in China.The editor of the nationalistic tabloid Global Times and also China’s most out-spoken journalist, Hu Xijin, said on Twitter: “Think long-term! And I bet the CPC will outlast the USA.”Asked by Bloomberg about Dimon’s comments at a news conference on Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian replied: “Why the publicity stunt with some grandstanding remarks?” according to an English language transcript of the remarks.Global executives typically choose their words carefully when discussing China, where foreign companies have occasionally been subject to backlash for perceived offences.Swiss bank UBS ran into trouble in 2019, after a remark by one of its senior economists about food inflation and swine fever was interpreted as a racist slur. He was suspended for three months and UBS lost a plum role on a bond deal for a state-backed client.Earlier this year, Swedish fashion giant H&M and US-based Nike Inc faced a backlash from Chinese state media and e-commerce platforms after expressing concern about allegations that forced labour had been used to produce cotton in Xinjiang.“The Chinese government has amply demonstrated its willingness to curb or in some cases shut down foreign businesses’ operations in the country if they challenge the government openly or even engage in perceived or indirect slights,” said Prasad.A week ago Dimon was granted an exemption by the Hong Kong government to visit the Chinese-controlled financial hub without needing to quarantine.Visitors to the city from most countries must stay in hotel quarantine for two to three weeks at their own cost.Dimon was in Hong Kong for 32 hours after arriving by private jet.“Jamie Dimon’s best and worst trait is that he speaks his mind,” said Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo.“It typically works well for him and makes him more authentic and appreciated by investors. But sometimes it gets him into trouble.”
