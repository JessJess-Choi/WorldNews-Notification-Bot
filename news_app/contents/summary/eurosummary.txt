Scientists in the UK have advised that all adults should now be included in the COVID-19 booster jab campaign in the wake of the spread of the Omicron variant. European country is currently in the midst of the world’s fastest rise in infections, and the measures, which include closing all non-essential stores, as well as bars and restaurants, are meant to help the struggling healthcare system. The nation of around four million people has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the European Union, with only 53 per cent of the total 
Rare footage of a polar bear chasing a reindeer into the water and killing it could be another stark indication of climate change. bear drowns the male victim, she drags it ashore in a move that indicates a change of diet for bears in Norway The facts that bears are stranded on land and that the number of reindeer has been steadily rising on Svalbard due to a 1925 hunting ban have resulted in the unusual phenomenon. 
With the world on high alert, a doctor in South Africa who was one of the first to suspect the different coronavirus strain has said the symptoms of the Omicron variant are mild and could be treated at home. The first case was detected on November 9 and last week three-quarters of the cases registered in South Africa - about 3,000 after a period with very few infections - are due to this variant. Scientists are concerned as the spike protein mutations could make this new variant more transmissible and it’s also possible the new variant may reduce the effectiveness of the available diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines. The overall global risk related to the new VOC [variant of concern] Omicron is assessed as very high," the World WHO said. 
across the continent were forced to delay or cancel treatment and surgeries to minimise the risk of vulnerable and ill people being exposed to the disease, particularly cancer patients. As the first wave of the pandemic hit, cancer diagnoses dropped by 42 per cent in April 2020 compared to the previous year. The number of surgeries also dropped across the board, with the number of colon cancer operations dropping the steepest by a third compared to 2019.In Poland, all forms of treatment were impacted by the pandemic, but breast cancer services, in particular, saw a reduction. 
Existing COVID-19 vaccines are likely to be much less effective against the Omicron variant of the virus than previous variants, the CEO of drugmaker Moderna has warned. Speaking to the Financial Times, Stéphane Bancel said the large number of mutations in the variant suggested that the world The high number of mutations in Omicron's spike protein - believed to be between 26 and 32 - is potentially "concerning" as it could make the variant more transmissible and more resistant to the protection given by vaccination or recovery from other variants of COVID-19, the WHO said.
